 What Will We Bake?
What will we make for the king?
Let's bake a cake for him.
He will like a big cake.
No! Let's make hot buns for him.
The king will love a big cake.
I will bake a cake and take it to the king!
I will bake buns and take it to the king!
He will like my buns but not your cake!
Look out for the lake!
Is this for me? What did you bake?
