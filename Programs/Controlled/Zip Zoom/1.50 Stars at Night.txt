 Stars at Night
Dad, what is that?
That is a star.
We can see stars when it is dark at night.
Let's go to that star in your car.
My car can't take us to that star.
It is far, far, away.
But I like that star.
Could you help me put it in this jar?
A star can't be put in a jar.
What do people do with stars?
Some people think looking at stars is the best.
I think looking at stars with you is the best, Dad.
Can that be our star?
