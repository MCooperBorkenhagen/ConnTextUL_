 Jake's Pet
Wake up, Jake!
Mom is going to take us to the pet store!
Let's go Jake!
We are going to the pet store.
A dog will make a good pet.
Do you want to take this dog with you?
Do you want a cat for a pet?
You can take this cat with you.
Do you want to take the cat or the dog?
What do you want Jake?
No, Jake, not a big snake!
