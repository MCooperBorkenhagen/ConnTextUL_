 The Boat Ride
Get your coat.
We are going to the lake for a ride on my boat.
What is this?
Is this your new boat?
Can it float?
This is a new coat.
I don't want to get my new coat wet.
Your coat will not get wet.
This boat can float on the lake.
Look out! A
goat is on the boat!
What is that goat doing on the boat?
I told you this boat could float.
But what about my new coat!
