 Run and hop
Gus and Lin run to school.
The school bell tells us to stop.
It is time for school.
It is 10 o'clock.
It is time to go out.
The school bell tells us to stop.
It is 3 o'clock.
Gus and Lin run and hop.
"We can run and hop!"
"There is no bell to tell us to stop!"
"Gus! Lin!
It is time to stop!"
