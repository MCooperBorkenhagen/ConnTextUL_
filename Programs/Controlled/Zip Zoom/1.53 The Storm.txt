 The Storm
"What is that?" says the farmer.
He looks at the sky.
"I think there's a storm coming!"
The farmer gets his horn and runs.
He runs by some pigs eating corn.
"There is a storm coming! Run!"
The farmer runs by a lake.
He plays his horn.
"Run. There's a storm coming!"
A man on a horse rides by.
"You need to stop or you will wake up the king."
"There isn't a storm coming."
The farmer says, "There isn't a storm?
What is that?"
"That's the king," says the man on the horse.
