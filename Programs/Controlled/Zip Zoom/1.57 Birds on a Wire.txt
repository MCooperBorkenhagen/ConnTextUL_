 Birds on a Wire
"Look over there!" said little birds on a wire.
"There is food for us to eat."
The first bird digs in the dirt for food.
The bird works hard and finds a worm to eat.
The second bird digs in the dirt, too.
The second bird works hard.
It can't get a worm but finds some seeds.
The third bird says, "I don't need to work hard.
I don't need to dig in the dirt."
The third bird finds a lot of food to eat!
A worm here, a worm there, a worm everywhere!
