 The Seed
The sun is out.
Do you have the seed?
We need to plant the seed.
We need to dig here but not there.
We need to dig and dig.
Put the seed in here.
We need to weed here and there.
We need to weed and weed.
We need to feed our seed.
We will see it grow and grow.
Is it growing?
No, it is not growing.
Our seed did not grow.
Let's dig and dig.
Let's look for the seed.
What is this?
This is not a seed!
