 Time to Plant Corn
The farmer wakes up.
He looks at the sky.
"Today is a good day to plant some corn.
But, I need to go to the store."
The farmer gets into his car.
He goes to a store to get some seeds.
He goes to many other places, too.
When he gets back to the farm, he sits down to eat.
"Look at the time.
I need to plant some corn!" he says.
The farmer looks up.
The sky is dark.
He sees a storm coming!
There's no time to plant some corn.
