 Going Out
"Dad, can we see this?"
"Look at that!
Let's get a good seat."
"Look at all the people.
Let's go!
I want to get a good seat."
"Look, Dad.
I want to eat this and I want to eat that."
"I want to get a seat over there so I can see."
"I can sit in this seat but not that seat."
"I have a good seat.
I can eat all of this!"
"Did you like your good seat?" says Dad.
"Yes, I had a good seat."
