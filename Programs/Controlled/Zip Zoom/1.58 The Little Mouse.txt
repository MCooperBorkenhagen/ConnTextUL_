 The Little Mouse
A little mouse had a big house by a mountain.
Many of her friends went to her house to eat.
The little mouse worked hard for all of her friends.
"I need help," said the little mouse.
"Who would like to help me?"
Her friends did not think to help her.
One day, the mouse went for a ride to the top of the mountain.
She found a little house.
In this little house, she would not need to work hard for all of her friends.
She found the best house for a little mouse!
