 Who Can Skip?
Kip likes to skip.
Who will skip with Kip?
Tim is Kip's little friend.
He is sad.
He can run but he cannot skip.
Jill is Kip's friend, too.
She will skip with Kip.
Look out, Jill!
Down she goes.
Her lip is red.
Tim runs and runs.
He gets Jill's dad.
Tim is a good friend.
He cannot skip but he can run.
