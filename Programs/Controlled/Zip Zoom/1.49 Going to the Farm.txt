 Going to the Farm
We need to get on the bus!
We are going to a farm!
What will we see at the farm?
I think we will see a farmer feed his goats.
Do you think we will see a farmer feed his pigs, too?
Yes.
The farmer will need our help to feed his goats, pigs, and horses.
We will have fun on the farm!
I have many seeds for you to plant on the farm.
Is this a farm?
We have seeds to plant?
Where are the goats, pigs, and horses?
