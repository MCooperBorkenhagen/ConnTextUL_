 Time For Friends
Kip's cat gets a toy.
"No, Nip," said Kip.
"I do not have time for you.
It is time to play with my friends."
Kip and his friends skip and run.
Nip wants to play, too.
She looks for her friend, Tip.
She tells Tip to get a toy.
The friends see the pets.
Let's play with Tip and Nip.
Pets can be friends, too.
