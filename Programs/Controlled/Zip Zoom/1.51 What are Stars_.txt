 What are Stars?
When you look at the sky at night, what do you see?
Do you see many stars in the night sky?
What is a star?
A star is a big ball of hot gas that gives off light.
Stars are far away from Earth.
The first star from Earth is our big sun.
At night there is no sun to give us light.
It is dark when there is no light.
There are lights to help people see in the dark.
But stars are little lights for us to see in the night sky.
