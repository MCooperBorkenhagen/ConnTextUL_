 Who's First?
"Let's go there.
I want to be the first to get some food to eat."
"I am first.
I will get all the seeds that I want," said the big bird.
"I am third," said the little bird.
"I don't think I will get too many seeds."
"I don't have seeds.
I need to get some seeds."
"I am first and you are third.
I will be first to get the seeds."
"What is he doing?
I am first!"
"I am first and you are third.
I will be the first to get the seeds."
