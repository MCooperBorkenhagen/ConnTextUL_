Houses.

By the red house
there is ...

a blue house.
And by the blue house
there is ...

a pink house.
And by the pink house
there is ...

a yellow house.
And by the yellow house
there is ...

a green house.
And by the green house
there is ...

a purple house.
And by the purple house
there is ...

a little orange man.
