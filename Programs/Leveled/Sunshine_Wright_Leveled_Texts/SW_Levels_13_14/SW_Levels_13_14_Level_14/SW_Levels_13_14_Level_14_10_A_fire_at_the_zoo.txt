A Fire at the Zoo.

"Help!" cried the keeper.
"There's a fire at the zoo!"
"We're coming!" said the lions.
"We know what to do."

They roared and they roared,
but they couldn't put it out,
so everyone joined in
with one tremendous shout --

"Help, help, help!"
"There's a fire at the zoo!"
"We're coming!" said the penguins.
"We know what to do."

They flipped and they flapped,
but they couldn't put it out,
so everyone joined in
with one tremendous shout --

"Help, help, help!"
"There's a fire at the zoo!"
"We're coming!" said the hippos.
"We know what to do."

They stamped and they stomped,
but they couldn't put it out,
so everyone joined in
with one tremendous shout --

"Help, help, help!"
"There's a fire at the zoo!"
"We're coming!" said the seals.
"We know what to do."

They slipped and they slopped,
but they couldn't put it out,
so everyone joined in
with one tremendous shout --

"Help, help, help!"
"There's a fire at the zoo!"
"We're coming!" said the peacocks
"We know what to do."

They splished and they sploshed,
but they couldn't put it out,
so everyone joined in
with one tremendous shout --

"Help, help, help!"
"There's a fire at the zoo!"
"I'm coming!" said the elephant.
"I know what to do."

She stretched out her trunk.
She gave a giant spout!

And everyone join in --

"She's put the fire out!"
