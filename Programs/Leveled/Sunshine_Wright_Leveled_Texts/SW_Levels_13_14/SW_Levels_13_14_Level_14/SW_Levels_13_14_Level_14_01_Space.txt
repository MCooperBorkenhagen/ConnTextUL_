Space.
What is up there?In the day, we can see the sun.Sometimes we can see the moon.The sun is the biggest thing in our sky.  It is our star.Every morning, the sun rises.  Every evening, the sun sets.At night, we can see the moon.Men have landed on the moon.  They could see the earth from there.At night, we can see comets and shooting stars.At night, we can see the planets.  No one has landed on a planet.At night, we can see the stars.  One day, we will go to the stars.I wonder what we will find.
