Mr. Fixit.

Haydon's dad fixed cars.  Haydon wanted to help him.

Not today, Mr. Fixit, said Dad.  This job isn't safe for you.  Go and fix your bike.

With Dad's wrench, Haydon undid all the nuts on this bike.

Soon the bike was in pieces, and Haydon couldn't put it together again.

Here, Mr. Fixit, let me help you, said Dad.

Then Dad said, Forget about the bike.  Go and fix something else.

Into the house went Haydon with Dad's wrench.

He climbed up on the chair and got down the clock.

When Mom came in, the clock was in little pieces all over table.

What have you done? Mom cried.

Dad said I could fix something, Haydon replied.

Mom took Haydon out to Dad.  Mr. Fixit has taken the clock apart, she said.

Dad groaned.  Oh, no!  Not the clock!

You said I could fix something, said Haydon.

Come here, Haydon, Dad said.  I've got a present for you.  It's an old carpet-sweeper.  You can take it apart and put it together again as often as you like.

Thanks, Dad! said Haydon.

Mr. Fixit likes his old carpet-sweeper, but ... he would still like to fix a car.
