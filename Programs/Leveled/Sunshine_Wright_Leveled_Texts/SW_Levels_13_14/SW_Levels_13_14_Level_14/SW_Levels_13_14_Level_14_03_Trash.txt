Trash!Hundreds of people came to the zoo each day.When they left, there was always trash everywhere.Come on, animals! called the keeper.  Time to clean up the trash.The animals grumbled among themselves.Trash gets up my nose, said the elephant.It's a pain in the neck, said the giraffe.Trash gets my back up, said the camel.Trash makes me hopping mad, the kangaroo replied.Trash drives me bananas, said the chimpanzee.It makes me squirm, said the snake.I can't bear it, said the koala.You're right, said the kookaburra.  It's no laughing matter.The keeper heard the grumbling.  We've got a problem, he said.  But I think I know how to fix it.The keeper got a board and some paints and made a huge sign.Don't trash our zoo!
