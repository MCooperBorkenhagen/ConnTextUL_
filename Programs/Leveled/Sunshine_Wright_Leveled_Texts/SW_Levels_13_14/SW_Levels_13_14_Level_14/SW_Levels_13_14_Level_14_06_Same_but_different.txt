Same but Different.

One wet day,
Tess and Eric drew some pictures.

Eric drew a red house with a green roof.

Tess drew a house, too.
Some smoke came out of her chimney
just like Eric's.

Eric drew some windows.

Tess's windows had curtains
just like Eric's.

Eric drew a cat on the window-sill,
a tree in the garden,
a blackbird on the roof
and a big shining sun.

Tess drew a cat, a tree,
a blackbird, a gate
and a big shining sun
just like Eric's.

Eric drew a boy and a girl
sitting on the front doorstep.

Tess drew a girl and a boy, too.
The girl looked a bit like Tess.
The boy looked a bit like Eric.

Eric looked at Tess's picture.
"Our pictures are the same," he said.

"No," said Tess.
Our pictures are different.
My house is green with a red roof.
The smoke is grey.
The windows are open.

The blackbird is on the gate.
The cat is in the tree
and the boy and girl are wearing
different clothes."

Eric laughed. He said,
"Our pictures are the same but different."
