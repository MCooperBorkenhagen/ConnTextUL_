The Accident.

My dad has a big red truck.
"Do you want to come for a ride?"
Dad said.

We went past the shops.
I waved to the people in the shops.
They waved back.

We went past the houses.
I waved to the people in the houses.
They waved back.

We went on the highway.
I waved to the people in the cars.
They waved back.

Then ...
the car in front of us stopped.
But Dad could not stop.

"Look out!" yelled Dad.
The truck went off the highway.
It hit a tree.

"Look at the truck!" I said.
"Don't cry!" said Dad.
"A truck is a just a truck.
No one got hurt."
