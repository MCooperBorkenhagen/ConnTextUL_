The Zoo Olympics.

The story of the Zoo Olympics
was in the newspaper.
But the story was wrong.

It said that the gazelle
won the swimming race.

It said that the kangaroo
won the tug-of-war.

The newspaper story
said that the sea lion
won the weight lifting.

It said that the hippopotamus
won the running race.

It said that the elephant
got a gold medal
for the high jump.

The people laughed and laughed
at the story.
"This story will not win
a gold medal," they said.
"This story is all wrong!"
