Nowhere and Nothing.

I lay on the bed, looking at the ceiling.  Dad called, Where are you going?  Nowhere.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  Why don't you go and play with your friends?  I don't have any friends.
I sat in the chair, looking at T.V.
Mom called, Where are you going?  Nowhere.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  Why don't you go and play with your friends?  I don't have any friends.  
I sat on the doorstep, watching people go down the street.  Some kids called out, Where are you going?  Nowhere.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  Why don't you play with your friends?  I don't have any friends.  Hey.  Come on.  Yelled the kids.  We are your friends.  Mom and Dad called, Where are you going?  To the park to play ball with all my friends.  That's where I'm going, and that's what I'm doing.
