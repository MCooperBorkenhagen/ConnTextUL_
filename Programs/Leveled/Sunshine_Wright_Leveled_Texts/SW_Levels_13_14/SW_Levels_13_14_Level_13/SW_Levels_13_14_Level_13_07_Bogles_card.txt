Bogle's Card.On Mother's Day, Bogle, the giant, made a beautiful card for his mother.It had flowers and butterflies and a rainbow on it.He put the card in his pocket and went to see his mother.  But on the way he dropped it.The card fell on the grass by a river.Two hikers came that way.  Look at this! they cried.  A beautiful tent and no one living in it!  Let's stay here for a while.Bogle came to his mother's house.  His mother was in the garden.Happy Mother's Day! said Bogle.  Here's a ...But the card wasn't there.I made you a beautiful card, but I must have dropped it, said Bogle.  You wait here while I go back and look for it.Bogle marched back over the countryside.  As he came to the river, he saw his beautiful card.  Two hikers were living in it.Bogle scratched his head.  I suppose that's that, he said.  I'll have to think of something else.Bogle went to the airport and called out to a pilot.  Excuse me!  Can a jumbo giant fit into a jumbo jet?If we take all the seats out, said the pilot.  Good! said Bogle.  I want to go for a ride.Bogle's mother waited and waited.  Where is that Bogle? she asked.  Then she looked up.A jet plane was writing in the sky, Happy Mother's Day.Bogle's mother laughed.  What a big card! she said.
