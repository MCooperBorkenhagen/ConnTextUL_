Grizzly and the Bumble-bee. 

Grizzly Bear was in the park looking for honey,
when a bumble-bee stung him on his paw.

Grizzly Bear ran out of the park 
shouting, "Help! Help!
I've been stung by a grumble-bee!"

"You mean a bumble-bee," said the park keeper.

"That's right, a mumble-bee,  said Grizzly,
who was not good at names.

Down the street ran Grizzly yelling, "Help! Help!
I've  been  stung by a crumble-bee!"

"Don't you mean a bumble-bee?" said a woman.

"That's what I said!" cried Grizzly
as he ran past.


Home he went to Old Mother Grizzly. 
"Help!  Help!  I've  been stung by a grumble-mumble.
Look at my paw!"
"What you need
is  something cool, 
said Old Mother  Grizzly. "Here, put your paw
in this bucket of  ice cream."

"What a good idea!" said Grizzly Bear.
"I'm feeling better already?

When Old Mother Grizzly came back all the ice cream was gone.

"I didn't tell you to  eat it!" she cried.

"I needed something cool
on the inside 
as well as the outside, said Grizzly Bear.  
"Ice cream  is very good when you get stung
by a beeble-bum."
