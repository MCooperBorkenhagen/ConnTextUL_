Dad's Headache.

Poor Dad!  He had a headache. 

I feel terrible! he said.

We got him some breakfast to make him feel better.  We let in the dog to make him feel better.  We told funny stories to make him feel better.

Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Amos.  Amos who?  A mosquito.  Ha, ha, ha!

We walked on our hands to make Dad feel better.  We played him some music.  We did a dance.

Stop that noise! said Dad.  Go and read some books!

That's better, said Dad.
