The "Get-Up" Machine.

This is the "get-up" machine.
It gets me up in the morning.

This is the ice that melts the sun.

This is the water
that comes from the ice
that melts in the sun.

This is the water
that comes from the ice
that runs down the pipe
that lifts up the duck.

This is the ball 
that rolls down the slide
that hits the lever
that pulls the rope.

This is the rope
that pulls the knob
that turns the wheel
that starts the engine.

This is the engine
that rings the bell
that wakes the elephant.

This is the elephant 
that shakes the bed
that wakes me up in time ...

... for school.
