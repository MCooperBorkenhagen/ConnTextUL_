My Sloppy Tiger.My tiger is very sloppy.  He spills his milk and wipes his face on the tablecloth.He never puts away his toys.  It takes me all morning to clean up his room.At lunch, I say, I think I'll go to town.My tiger is pleased.  He loves to go to town.  He gets so excited, he spills a dish of jam down his fur.You sloppy old tiger, I say.  Now you'll have to have a shower.My tiger bounds into the shower.  Splish, splash, and he's out again.  There is water all over the bathroom.You'd better clean that up, I say to him, or we don't go to town.Away bounds my tiger.  He comes back, grinning.  He has cleaned the bathroom with my T-shirt.What will I do with you, you sloppy tiger? I say.  Now you'll have to wash my T-shirt.My tiger goes away.  Scrub, scrub, scrub.He comes back, holding up the T-shirt.  His claws have made big holes in it.Look at those holes! I cry. My tiger wants to mend the T-shirt, but I tell him, no.I'll get a new one in town, I say.My tiger is very pleased.  He loves to go to town.  He gets so excited ... he steps in a pot of paint.
