The Poor Sore Paw.Dog was going across the bridge, when he got his paw stuck.He pulled and pulled until his paw was sore, and he couldn't get free.Dog sat down and howled.  How-ow-ow-ow!  How-ow-ow-ow!Goat was going home across the bridge, but Dog was in the way.  Move over! said Goat.I can't, said Dog.  My poor sore paw is stuck.Then I can't go home, Goat said.  Maa-aa-aa-aa! Maa-aa-aa-aa!Cow was on her way home.  Off the bridge! she yelled.We can't! said Goat.  I can't go because of Dog.  Dog can't go because his poor sore paw is stuck in the bridge.Then I can't go home for my dinner! said Cow.She sat down and howled too.  Moo-oo-oo-oo!  Moo-oo-oo-oo!The farmer was going home.  What a traffic jam! he said.  Move off the bridge!We can't, said Cow.  I can't go because of Goat.  Goat can't go because of Dog.  Dog can't go because his poor saw paw is stuck in the bridge.No dinner for me! said the farmer.  He sat down and howled.  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!Along came Jessie and Sam.What's all this howling? they said.  We want to go home.We want to go home too, said the farmer, but we cant.  I can't go because of Cow.  Cow can't go because of Goat.  Goat can't go because of Dog.  Dog can't go because his poor sore paw is stuck in the bridge.  We won't get any dinner.Then the farmer howled, Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!And the cow howled, Moo-oo-oo-oo! Moo-oo-oo-oo!And the goat howled, Maa-aa-aa!  Maa-aa-aa-aa!And the dog howled, How-ow-ow-ow!  How-ow-ow-ow!No dinner! they howled.Jessie and Sam walked over the farmer, over the cow, over the goat, over the dog.Jessie held the poor sore paw.  Sam moved the wood on the bridge.The poor sore paw came out.  Dog was free.Dog and Goat and Cow and the farmer stopped howling.  They went over the bridge.  Then they all went home for their dinner.
