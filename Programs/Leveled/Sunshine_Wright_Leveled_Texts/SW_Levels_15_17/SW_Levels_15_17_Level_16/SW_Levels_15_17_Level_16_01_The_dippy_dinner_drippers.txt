The Dippy Dinner Drippers.

The Dippy family
were messy eaters.
They dropped their food
and dripped their drink
at every meal.

In the morning
it was cornflakes
and marmalade and milk.
Slip and drip,
slop and drop.

At midday
it was soup
and bread and melon.
Slip an drip,
slop and drop.

At night
it was spaghetti
and salad and custard.
Slip and drip,
slop and drop.

Their clothes looked
like weird and wonderful
works of art.

One day,
a hungry goat
followed them home.

At night it came
in the window
and ate their clothes.

"Our clothes have gone!"
cried Mr. Dippy.
"What will we wear?"
cried Mrs. Dippy.
"We will have to buy
some new clothes,"
Little Dippy said.

And so the Dippy family
went shopping.

They liked their new clothes
so much that they decided
to wear them to the circus.

While they watched
the monkeys,
they had ice cream
and chocolate
and raspberry drink.
Slip and drip,
slop and drop.

Then they had 
peanuts and popcorn
and hot dogs.
Slip and drip,
slop and drop.

A hungry monkey
followed them home ...
