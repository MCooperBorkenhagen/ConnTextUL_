Josiah's Bird.

Josiah saw a little bird
hopping along the road.
"Look out, little bird!"
he said. "Look out for the car!"

The car went past.
Josiah looked for the little bird.
It was lying on the road.

Josiah picked the little bird up
and took it inside.
He gave it some water.

He put a seed in
the little bird's mouth.

Josiah took the little bird
outside into the sun.
He sang to it:
Little bird, little bird,
look up at the sky.
Little bird, little bird,
you can fly, fly, fly.

The little bird opened its eyes.
It moved its winds
up and down, up and down,
and then it flew ... up, up, up
into the sky.

Josiah looked jump at the little bird.
He sang to it:
Little bird, Little bird,
up in the sky.
Little bird, little bird,
good-bye, good-bye.
