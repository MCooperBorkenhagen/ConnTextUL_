Mrs. Grimble's Grapevine.

Mrs. Grimble had a grapevine
in her garden.
She loved to eat the grapes.

But the birds in Mrs. Grimble's garden
loved to eat the grapes, too.
When Mrs. Grimble went inside
her house, the birds flew down
to the grapevine and ate
and ate and ate.

Mrs. Grimble came out of her house
and shook the grapevine.
"Shoo, shoo!" she said to the birds.
"You cannot eat my grapes."

But when Mrs. Grimble 
went inside her house,
the birds came back.

Mrs. Grimble got a hose
and hosed the birds.
"Shoo, shoo!" she said to the birds.
"You cannot eat my grapes."

But when Mrs. Grimble 
went inside her house,
the birds came back.

Mrs. Grimble got some straw.
She got a hat, a shirt, and some sticks.
"I will make a scarecrow," she said.

Mrs. Grimble put the scarecrow
by the grapevine.
"Don't let the birds eat my grapes!"
she said to the scarecrow.

But when Mrs. Grimble went inside 
her house, the birds came back.
They sat on the scarecrow's arms
and ate grapes.

So Mrs. Grimble got a net.
She put the net over and under 
and around the grapevine.
"Now, you cannot eat my grapes,"
she said to the birds.

But when Mrs. Grimble went inside 
her house, the birds came back.
They could see the grapes,
but they could not eat the grapes.
They could not get under the net.

"Good!" said Mrs. Grimble.
"Now the birds cannot eat my grapes.
I will eat the grapes myself."

Mrs. Grimble went into her garden
to eat the grapes,
but she could not get under the net!

Mrs. Grimble sat on the grass
and looked at the grapes.
The birds sat in the trees
and looked at the grapes.
"I love grapes," said Mrs. Grimble,
"but the birds love grapes, too."

Then Mrs. Grimble jumped up.
She took the net off the grapevine.
"Come on, birds!" she said.
"Grapes are for eating!"
