Yum and Yuk.Who's hungry? said Mom.We are, said the children.  Me, too, said the hen.Then come to breakfast, said Mom.The hen and the children sat down at the table.Eggs for breakfast, said Mom.Yum! said the children.Yuk! said the hen.The children ate up the eggs.  The hen sat and looked at them.Come with me, said the hen.  I'll get you a good breakfast.The children got up from the table.  They all went to the hen house.Here it is, said the hen.  Sit down and help yourselves.The children looked in the dish.  Worms! they said.The hen ate some.Come on, eat up, she said.  Worms are good for you.Yuk! said the children.Yum! said the hen.
