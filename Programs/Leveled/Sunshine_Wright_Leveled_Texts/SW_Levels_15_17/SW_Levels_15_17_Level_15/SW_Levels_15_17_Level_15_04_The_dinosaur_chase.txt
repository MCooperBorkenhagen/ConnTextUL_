The  Dinosaur Chase.  

One day,
Big  Dinosaur chased Little Dinosaur into a  hole in  a rock.

Big  Dinosaur was very hungry.
He sat and waited
for Little Dinosaur to come  out.



Big Dinosaur saw Little Dinosaur's nose come out
of the hole.


He saw
Little Dinosaur's head come out.



Then Little Dinosaur jumped at the lizard,

and Big  Dinosaur jumped at Little Dinosaur but Big Dinosaur was too slow.
Little Dinosaur raced away, just in time.
(So did the brown lizard).



Big Dinosaur chased Little Dinosaur in and out of the trees.
Big Dinosaur had great long  legs.



Big Dinosaur
could run very fast,
but the  trees got in the way, and he could not catch up.

Then Little Dinosaur raced down to the ferns that  grew in  the wet mud by the  river.
Big Dinosaur  was right behind him.
Big Dinosaur was so big that he made
the ground  shake.

Little Dinosaur jumped from fern to fern. Then he ran across the  mud.
Big  Dinosaur chased him,


but
Big Dinosaur was too
big
and too
heavy.
His
legs went down into
the
mud.

Big
Dinosaur was stuck!


Big  Dinosaur  was  stuck  for a long time, and so,  once again,
lucky Little Dinosaur got away!
