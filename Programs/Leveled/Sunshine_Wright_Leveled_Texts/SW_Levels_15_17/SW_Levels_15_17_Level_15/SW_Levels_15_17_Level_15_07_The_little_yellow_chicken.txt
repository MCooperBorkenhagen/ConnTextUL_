The Little Yellow Chicken.

The little yellow chicken
thought he'd have a party.
He said to his friends,
"Will you help me
do the shopping?"
His friends laughed at him.

"Hop it!" said the frog.
"Buzz off!" said the bee.
And the big brown beetle
said, "Stop bugging me!"
So the little yellow chicken
went shopping by himself.

When the shopping was done,
the little yellow chicken
said to his friends,
"Will you help me
do the cooking?
His friends shook
their head.

"Hop it!" said the frog.
"Buzz off!" said the bee.
And the big brown beetle
said, "Stop bugging me!"
So the little yellow chicken
did the cooking by himself.

When the cooking was done,
the little yellow chicken
said to his friends,
"Will you help me
set the table?"
His friends turned
their backs.

"Hop it!" said the frog.
"Buzz off!" said the bee.
And the big brown beetle
said, "Stop bugging me!"
So the little yellow chicken
set the table by himself.

Everything was ready
for the party.
The food smelled delicious.
The friends knocked on 
the little yellow chicken's
door.

"I'm hungry!"
said the frog.
"I'm starving!"
said the bee.
And the big brown beetle
said, "What about me?"

The little yellow chicken
phoned his grandmother,
the little red hen.
"My friends wouldn't help 
me," he said.
"Now they want
to come to my party.
What shall I do?"

"Don't let them in,"
said the little red hen.
"Eat all the food yourself."

But the little yellow chicken
was a kind little chicken.
He thought and thought.

Then he opened the door.
"Welcome to my party!"
he said to his friends.

"Fantastic!" said the frog.
"Amazing!" said the bee.
And the big brown beetle
said, "A scrumptious tea!"

Then they said
to the little yellow chicken,
"We're sorry we were lazy.
The next time
you have a party,
we'll do all the work."

"That's a good idea,"
said the little yellow chicken.
