Mom's Birthday.

Mom's birthday was soon.
Sara wanted to get her a present.
What can I give my Mom? she asked the man upstairs.  Chocolates! said the man upstairs.  She'd like a box of chocolates.
Where are you going? said the woman with the tattoos.  To get my Mom some chocolates for her birthday, said Sara.  Chocolates are fattening, said the woman with the tattoos.  Why don't you get her a book?
Sara talked to the man who was sweeping the street.  Don't get your mother a book, he said.  Books don't smell sweet.  Get her some nice flowers.
The woman selling newspapers called out, No, no.  Not flowers.  Flowers don't last.  If you want a sweet smell, buy some perfume.
Sara told her teacher about the perfume she would get for her mother's birthday.  Her teacher said, Some perfumes make people sneeze.  Some perfumes give people spots.  Why don't you ask your mother what she wants?
When Sara went home, she said to her mother, Mom, what would you like best in the whole world?  Mom shut her eyes.  let me think, she said.  Then Mom said, I'll tell you what I'd like best in the whole world.  It's better than chocolates, better than books, better than flowers, and better than perfume.  What? said Sara.  A birthday card made for me by my clever Sara, said Mom.
