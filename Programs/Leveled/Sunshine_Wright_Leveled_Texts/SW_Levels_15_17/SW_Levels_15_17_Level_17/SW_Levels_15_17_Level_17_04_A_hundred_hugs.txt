A Hundred Hugs.Huggles gives away a hundred hugs a day.He has to start very early in the morning.How are you today? he says to the milk carrier.Don't ask me! she grumbles.What you need is a hug, says Huggles, and he gives her one.I'm fine, thank you, says the milk carrier.Out of the house and down the street goes Huggles.He hugs the people waiting at the bus stop.  Some of them are surprised.  Most of them are pleased.The man with the umbrella says, There's nothing like a hug to start the morning.The woman with the bag says, It does feel rather nice.Huggles goes to school and hugs the children on the playground.He hugs the teacher.You've just squashed my lunch, says the teacher.  But I don't mind.It isn't easy to hug people on an escalator.  Sometimes, Huggles hugs a shopping bag by mistake.The man on the corner is playing a slow, sad song on his banjo.Good morning, says Huggles.What's good about it? says the man.You sound miserable, says Huggles.I am miserable, the man replies.  I play all day, and no one listens.What you need, says Huggles, is a big hug.How much are they? asks the man.Nothing, says Huggles.  Hugs are free.Good! says the man.  I'll take ten.Hugs make people happy, says Huggles.
