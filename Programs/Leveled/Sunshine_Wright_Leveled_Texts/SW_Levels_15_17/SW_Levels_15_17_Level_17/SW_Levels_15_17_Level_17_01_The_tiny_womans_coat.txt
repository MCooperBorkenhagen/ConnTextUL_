The Tiny Woman's Coat.
The tiny woman wanted a coat.Where will I get the cloth?You can have our leaves, said the autumn trees.Rustle, rustle, rustle.The tiny woman wanted a coat.  Where will I get some scissors?Try me instead, the gray goose said.  Snip, snip, snip.The tiny woman wanted a coat.  Where will I get a needle?Have one of mine, said the porcupine.  Sharp, sharp, sharp.The tiny woman wanted a coat.  Where will I get some thread?My mane of course, said the friendly horse.  Stitch, stitch, stitch.The tiny woman wanted a coat.  Where will I get some buttons?Take some of our seeds, said the wild wet weeds.One, two, three.The tiny woman put on her coat and went out into the storm.  She stayed as snug as a bug in a rug, with her coat to keep her warm.
