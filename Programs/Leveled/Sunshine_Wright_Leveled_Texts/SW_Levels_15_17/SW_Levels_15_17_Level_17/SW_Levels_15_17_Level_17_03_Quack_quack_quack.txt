Quack, Quack, Quack!

Quack, Quack, Quack!

One wet day, Dad took us to school
in the car.

"Good day for ducks," he said.
"Quack, Quack, Quack!"

Dad got out of the car and took us across
the road to the school gate.

He walked like a duck and made duck noises.
"Quack, quack, quack!"

The next day was wet again.

We said to Mum, "Will you take us
to school? We don't want to go with Dad.
He embarrasses us."

Then we told Mum about the duck noises.


Dad came in from the shower.
All he was wearing was a towel.

Mum said to him, "The children
don't want you to take them
to school. You embarrass them."

"What have I done now?" said Dad.

"You made duck noises," Mum replied.


Dad said, "If I want to make duck noises,
I'll make duck noises!"

He went out the door and ran around
the house yelling, "Quack, quack, quack!"


"Quick!" laughed Mum. "Let's lock the doors!"

We ran through the house, locking all
the doors.


Dad couldn't get back in. He stood
in his towel in the rain.

"Let me in!"

"No more duck noises," said Mum.

"All right," he said. "No more duck noises."


That morning we went to school in the car.

Dad grinned. "Good day for frogs," he said.
"Croak, croak, croak!"
