Mrs. Grindy's Shoes.Mrs. Grindy was tired of her shoes.  She went to the store for some new ones.You've come to the right place, said the salesclerk.  I have hundreds of shoes.  I'll find the shoes that are right for you.Left and right, said Mrs. Grindy.How about these red shoes?  You would look good in red.I don't like red, said Mrs. Grindy.Well, how about these blue shoes?  Blue is your color.I don't like blue, said Mrs. Grindy.Look! said the salesclerk.  These shoes have no toes and no heels.  They're the latest fashion.My feet would get cold, said Mrs. Grindy.For cold feet, you should try furry boots, said the salesclerk.I don't like furry boots, said Mrs. Grindy.High heels! said the salesclerk.Too high! said Mrs. Grindy.Flat heels! said the salesclerk.Too flat! said Mrs. Grindy.The salesclerk kept on bringing shoes.Mrs. Grindy kept on trying them.There were hundreds of shoes on the floor of the store.At last, Mrs. Grindy found some shoes she liked.These are the ones!  They're the right color.  They look right.  They feel right.  I'll take them!Oh, Mrs. Grindy! cried the salesclerk.  Those are the old shoes you were wearing when you came in here.
