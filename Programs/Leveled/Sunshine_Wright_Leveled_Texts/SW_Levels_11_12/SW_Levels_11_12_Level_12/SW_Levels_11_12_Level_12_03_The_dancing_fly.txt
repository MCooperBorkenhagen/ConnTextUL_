The Dancing Fly.There was a little fly, and it flew in to the store.It danced on the window, and it danced on the door.It danced on the bread, and it danced on the jam.It danced on the table, and it danced on the ham.It danced on the counter, and it danced on the fan.It danced on the head of the storekeeper man.Now, the storekeeper man got a big fly swatter to swat the little fly with a split, splat, splotter!But before he could count up to nine or ten ... the little fly was dancing on his head again.Dance!  Dance!  Dance!  Swat!  Swat!  Swat!  Dance!
