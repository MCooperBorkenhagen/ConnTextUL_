Obadiah.
Obadiah jumped in the fire.The fire was hot, so he jumped in the pot.The pot was black, so he jumped in a sack.The sack was full, so he jumped in a pool.The pool was wet, so he jumped in a net.The net was fishy, so he jumped in a dishy.The dishy was hard, so he jumped in the yard.The yard was yuck, so he jumped in a truck.The truck was loud, so he jumped in a cloud.The cloud flew away, so he jumped in the hay.The hay was just right, so he stayed there all night.
