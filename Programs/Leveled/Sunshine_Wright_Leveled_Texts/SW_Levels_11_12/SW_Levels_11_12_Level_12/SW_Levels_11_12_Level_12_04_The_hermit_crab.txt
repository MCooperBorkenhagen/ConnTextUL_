The Hermit Crab.
Hermit crabs live in rock pools.  Many other things live in rock pools, too.This hermit crab has to find a new shell to live in. That is not easy.Some shells are too big. Some shells are too little.  Some shells have shellfish living in them.Some shells are homes for other hermit crabs.There is a seagull.  Look out!  The hermit crab hides in its shell.  The shell is too tight.  Where can the hermit crab find a new home?  It looks in the seaweed.  It looks in the sand.  Here is a shell.  It is empty.  It is not too tight.  It is not too small.  It is just right.  The hermit crab is safe, now.
