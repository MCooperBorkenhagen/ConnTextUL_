The Bear on the Mountain.

A bear lived in a cave
on the mountain.
"This is my mountain," he said.

Birds came to the mountain.
They made nests on the rocks.

Spiders came to the mountain.
They made webs in the grass.

Bees came to the mountain.
They made hives in the trees.

The bear saw the birds,
the bees, and the spiders.
"Go away! Go away!" he said.
"This is my mountain."

"Your mountain?" said the birds,
and they flew around and around
the bear's head.

"Your mountain?" said the bees,
and they buzzed around and around
the bear's ears.

"Your mountain?" said the spiders,
and they crawled over the bear's back
and down the bear's tail.

"Stop! Stop! Stop!" said the bear,
and he ran into his cave.

The birds and the bees and the spiders
went after the bear.

They looked into the bear's cave.
"This is your cave," they said.
"But this is our mountain, too."
