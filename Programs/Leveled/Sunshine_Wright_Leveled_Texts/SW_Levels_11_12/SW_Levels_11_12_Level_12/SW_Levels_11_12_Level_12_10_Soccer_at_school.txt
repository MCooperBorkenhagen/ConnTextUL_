Soccer at School.

Matt said to James,
"Let's go and find a place
where we can kick my soccer ball.

The big children came to play
on the grass, so James and Matt
went over by the trees.

"This is not a good place
to kick the ball," said Matt.
"Let's see if we can go
on the grass."


They went over to a big boy
named Andy.

"We want to play soccer
on the grass," said Matt.
"Can we play here with you?"

"No, you can't," said Andy.
"We always play here."


Matt and James walked slowly
back to the trees.

Then they saw Andy kick the ball
off the grass.
It went all the way
over to the school
and hit the wall.


A teacher got the ball.
"I'm going to take this soccer ball
away from you," he said to Andy.
"You can have it back after school."

The big children sat down
on the grass.

Matt looked at James.
"They don't have a ball now,"
he said.


Matt shouted to Andy,
"I have got a soccer ball.
We can all play with it, if you like."

The big children looked at the ball.
"Come on," said Andy.


So Matt and James
ran to play soccer on the grass
with the big children.
