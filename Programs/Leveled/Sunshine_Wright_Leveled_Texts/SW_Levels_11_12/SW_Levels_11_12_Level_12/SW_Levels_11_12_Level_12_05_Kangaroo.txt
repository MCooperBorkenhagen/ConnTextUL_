Kangaroo.

Kangaroo went jumping over the grass.
Jump! Jump! Jump!
She had a baby in her pouch.

But ... the baby fell out
on his head.
Bump! Bump! Bump!

Kangaroo stopped,
and the baby got back
into the pouch.

Kangaroo went jumping
over the grass. 
Jump! Jump! Jump!

But ... the baby fell out
on his head.
Bump! Bump! Bump!

"What will I do?" said Kangaroo.
"When I jump, my baby
falls out on his head!"

Owl looked down from the tree.
"You need a seat belt
for your baby," said Owl,
"so he won't fall out on his head."

Kangaroo made a seat belt
for her baby.

Kangaroo went jumping over the grass. 
Jump! Jump! Jump!

"I have a seat belt!"
said the baby.
"Now, I won't fall out on my head!"
