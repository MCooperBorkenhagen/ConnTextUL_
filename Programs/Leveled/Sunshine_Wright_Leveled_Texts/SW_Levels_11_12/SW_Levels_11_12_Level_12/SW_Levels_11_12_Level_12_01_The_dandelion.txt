The Dandelion.

One o'clock, two o'clock,
three o'clock ...

The dandelion seeds
floated on the wind.

Some landed in the water.
Some landed on the road.
They did not grow.

One dandelion seed
landed in the garden.
Winter came
and covered it with snow.

In spring, the sun shone.
It was warm.

The dandelion seed
began to grow.

The roots grew.

The leaves grew.

The stem grew.

The flower grew.

The seeds came.

One o'clock, two o'clock,
three o'clock ...

The dandelion seeds
floated on the wind.
Some landed in the water.
Some landed on the road.

One seed landed in a garden.
