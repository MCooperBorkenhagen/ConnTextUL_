Hairy Bear.

Hairy Bear, Hairy Bear,

I can hear robbers.

I don't care, I don't care, I'll fim-fam-fight 'em.

Hairy Bear, Hairy Bear, I can still hear robbers. 

I don't care, I don't care, I'll bim-bam-bash 'em.

Hairy Bear, Hairy Bear, I'm frightened of the robbers.

I don't care, I don't care, I'll crim-cram-crash 'em.

Hairy Bear, Hairy Bear, they might get all our money.

I don't care, I don't care, I'll zim-zam-zap 'em.  And I'll do it in the morning.

Hairy Bear, Hairy Bear, you're just a scary bear.

I'm not a scary bear.  I'm a brave and dare-y bear.
