I'm Glad to Say.I went up flying, I went up flying, I went up flying, I'm glad to say.The engine fell to pieces, the engine fell to pieces, the engine fell to pieces, I'm sad to say.I had a new parachute, I had a new parachute, I had a new parachute, I'm glad to say.The parachute was broken, the parachute was broken, the parachute was broken, I'm sad to say.I saw a big haystack, I saw a big haystack, I saw a big haystack, I'm glad to say.In it there was a pitchfork, in it there was a pitchfork, in it there was a pitchfork, I'm sad to say.I missed the pitchfork, I missed the pitchfork, I missed the pitchfork, I'm glad to say.I also missed the haystack, I also missed the haystack, I also missed haystack, I'm sad to say.Nearby was a duck pond, nearby was a duck pond, nearby was a duck pond ... I'm glad to say.
