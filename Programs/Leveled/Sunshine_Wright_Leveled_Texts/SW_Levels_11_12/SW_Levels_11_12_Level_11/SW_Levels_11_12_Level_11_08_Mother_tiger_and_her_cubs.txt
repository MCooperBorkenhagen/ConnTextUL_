Mother Tiger and her cubs. 

Mother Tiger
had three little cubs to look after.
She hid her cubs
in a hole in the rocks.

She stayed  in  the hiding  place,  too.


One day,  Mother Tiger said, "I am  very hungry.
I have had no food  for a week.
I will have to find a pig to eat."

"My cubs are asleep," she said. "Now I can go down to the river."


Mother Tiger
went down to the river, to look for  a pig.
She hid in the long grass. "I am so  hungry," she said.


The little cubs woke up. They  went  outside the hole in the  rocks
to look for Mother Tiger.

They  cried  out for her, but she did not  come.
She was down by the river.


The sun went down,
and a pig came to the river.

Mother Tiger jumped out of the long grass,
and she got the pig.


Mother Tiger
ran  all the way back to the rocks.
She went inside the hole, but her cubs had gone!


Mother Tiger ran  outside. She cried  out  to her cubs.

The cubs cried  out,  too,
and  then they ran over to her, one  by one.
Mother Tiger fed her cubs with milk.
And they all went to sleep in the hole in the rocks.
