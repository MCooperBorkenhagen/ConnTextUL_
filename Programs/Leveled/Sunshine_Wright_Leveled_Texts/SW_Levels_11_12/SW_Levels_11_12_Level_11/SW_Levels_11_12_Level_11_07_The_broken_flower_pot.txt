The broken flower pot.

Katie  kicked  the ball to  Joe.

"Look out, Joe," she shouted. "Here it comes."

The
ball
went way up

over
and
the
into
fence,
the garden next
door.


Crash!

Joe and Katie ran  to the fence.

"Look at Sally's flower pot!" said Joe.
"The ball has broken it!"

"Look at the flowers, too,"

Mom came out.
She saw  the broken  flower pot, and  she saw  the flowers.

"Sorry, Mom," said Katie.

They  went over to Sally's place, but she was not  at  home.

"We will  have to get Sally
a new flower pot," said Mom.


They went back home.
Joe got an  old  flower pot 
out of the  shed.

"We can  make this old pot look  like  a new one,"
he said.
"We can  paint it."
Joe painted  the  old  pot blue.

Katie said,
"The  old  pot looks good now, but I can  make it  look better.
I will paint
some yellow flowers on  it."


Mom said,
"You  are  very clever. We will let  the pot dry in the sun."

"Then we can plant
Sally's flowers again," said Joe.


Sally came home
 and saw her new flower pot. "I love it," she  said.
