Duck and Hen.

Duck and Hen were friends.

They sang, Whatever the day, whatever the weather, friends do everything together.

Duck flew over the fence.  Hen flew over the fence. 

Duck went down the path.  Hen went down the path.

They sang,

Whatever the day, whatever the weather, friends do everything together.

Hen said, I'm hungry.  Let's scratch in the earth for worms.

Duck tried to scratch in the earth.

I can't, said Duck.  I don't have scratching feet.

How do you get your food? said Hen.

I dive in the pond for bugs, said Duck.  All right, said Hen.  Let's dive together.

So Hen went to the pond, and Duck went to the pond.

They sang,

Whatever the day, whatever the weather, friends do everything together.

Hen went in the water.  Duck went in the water.

Help!  Help! spluttered Hen.  I don't have swimming feet!

Duck helped Hen out of the pond.

Then Hen went away to scratch in the earth for worms.

And Duck went away to dive in the pond for bugs.

That night, Hen and Duck sang,

Whatever the day, whatever the weather, friends can do most things together - but not everything!
