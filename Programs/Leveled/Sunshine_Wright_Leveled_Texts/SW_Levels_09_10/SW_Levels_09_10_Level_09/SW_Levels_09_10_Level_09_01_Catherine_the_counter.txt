Catherine the Counter.

Catherine liked 
to count everything.
She liked to count
the hairs on Grandpa's head.

She liked to count
the fish in the bowl.

She liked to count
the buttons on people's coats.

She liked to count
the cars parked in the street.

She liked to count 
the cookies in the jar.

She liked to count
the peas on her plate.

She even liked to count
the stripes on the tiger
at the zoo.

But most of all,
Catherine liked to count
the days until her birthday!
