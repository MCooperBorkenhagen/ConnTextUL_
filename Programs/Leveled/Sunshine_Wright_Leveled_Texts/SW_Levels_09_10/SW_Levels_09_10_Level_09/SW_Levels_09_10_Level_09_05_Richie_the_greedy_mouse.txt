Richie the Greedy Mouse.

Richie was hungry.
Richie was famished.
He ate and he ate, and
soon the cheese vanished.

"More food!" Richie cried,
and twitching his nose,
he thought he smelled ...
sausages sitting in rows.

"Sausages, sausages!
Oh, what a treat!
Sausages, sausages!
So good to eat!"

Richie was hungry.
Richie was famished.
He ate and he ate,
and the sausages vanished.

"More food!" Richie cried,
and twitching his nose,
he thought he smelled ...
chocolates sitting in rows.

"Chocolates, chocolates!
Oh, what a treat!
Chocolates, chocolates!
So good to eat!

Richie was hungry.
Richie was famished.
He ate and he ate, and
the chocolates vanished.

"More food!" Richie cried,
and twitching his nose,
he thought he smelled ...
cream puffs sitting in rows.

"Cream puffs, cream puffs!
Oh, what a treat!
Cream puffs, cream puffs!
So good to eat!"

Richie is happy.
Richie is fat.
But ...

Look out!
Here is trouble!
It's Ginger the cat!
