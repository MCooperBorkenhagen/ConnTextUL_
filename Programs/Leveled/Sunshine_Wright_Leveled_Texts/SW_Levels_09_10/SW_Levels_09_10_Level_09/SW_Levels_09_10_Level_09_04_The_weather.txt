The Weather.

Dad looked at the sky.
"The sky is red tonight," he said.


Dad said, "Red sky at night
tells us that tomorrow
might be a fine day.


Dad and I watched TV.
"It will be fine tomorrow," I said.


The next day, it was fine.
The sky was blue.
The clouds were white.
The wind was gentle.


Dad looked at the sky.
"The sky is red this morning,"
he said.
"Red sky in the morning
tells us tomorrow it might rain."


Dad and I watched TV.
"It will rain tomorrow," I said.
"There will be lightning 
and thunder."


The next day, there was a storm.
There was rain, lightning,
and thunder.


Dad was right about the weather.
He looked at the sky.
I was right about the weather.
I looked at TV.


"Will it be fine or stormy tomorrow?"
asked Dad.
"I know what it will be," I said.
