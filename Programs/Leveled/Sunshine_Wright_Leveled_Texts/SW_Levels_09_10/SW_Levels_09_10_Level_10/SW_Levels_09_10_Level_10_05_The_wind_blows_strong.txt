The Wind blows strong.
The wind blows strong.Listen to the noise!The bells make a noise.  Ting-ting, ting-ting, ting-ting.  The door makes a noise. Bang, bang.The chimney makes a noise.  Whoo-oo-oo, whoo-oo-oo.  The roof makes a noise.  Crash, crash, crash.  The wind blows strong. Listen to the wind the windmill makes.  Creak, creak, creak.  The trees make a noise.  Sh-sh-sh, sh-sh-sh, sh-sh-sh.  The leaves make a noise.  Crackle, crackle, crackle.  The flags make a noise.  Flutter, flutter, flutter.  The papers make a noise.  Rustle, rustle, rustle.  The waves make a noise.  Splash, splash.  The sails make a noise.  Flap, flap, flap.  The wind blows strong.  I make a noise too.  Listen!Yippee!
