Come for a Swim!

Mom. Dad. Come for a swim! the children called.
Coming! Said Dad, and he ran into the water.
Coming! Said Mom, and she put on her suntan oil.
Come on, Mom! They called.
Coming! Said Mom, and she lay on the towel.
Dad and the children were waiting.  They called to Mom, Why don't you come in for a swim.  I am coming, said Mom, and she shut her eyes.
Dad got a bucket.  He filled it with water.  He dumped the water over Mom.  Mom yelled.  Mom ran after Dad.  You wait! She yelled.  I'll get you!  Dad ran into the water.  Mom ran after him.  Mom and Dad splashed each other.  They fell over and laughed and laughed.  Then Mom and Dad and the children had a swim.
