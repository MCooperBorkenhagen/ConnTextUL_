Trees Are Special.

Trees are very special.

Without trees,
we would not have
many kinds of fruit.

Without trees,
we would not have nuts
like walnuts and almonds.

Without trees,
we would not have homes
for many birds and animals.

Without trees,
we would not have forests.

Without trees,
we would not have
wood to build houses.

Trees are very special.
We make paper from trees,
and without paper,
we would not have books,
like this, to read!

From Trees to Books.
Trees logs
paper mills paper.
printers and publishers
books to read.
