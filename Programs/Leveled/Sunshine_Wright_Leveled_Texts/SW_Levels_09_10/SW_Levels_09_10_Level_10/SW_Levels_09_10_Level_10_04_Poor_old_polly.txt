Poor old Polly.

Old Polly found a frog; 
She swapped it for a dog.
The dog wouldn't bark; she swapped it for a shark.
The shark looked too savage; she swapped it for a cabbage.
The cabbage was too big; she swapped it for a pig.
The pig got too bony; she swapped it for a pony.
The pony wouldn't trot; she swapped it for a pot.
The pot wouldn't cook; she swapped it for a book.
The book had no pictures; she swapped it for some britches.
The britches were too loose; she swapped them for a goose.
The goose gave her a bite, and flew off, out of sight.
Poor old Polly!
