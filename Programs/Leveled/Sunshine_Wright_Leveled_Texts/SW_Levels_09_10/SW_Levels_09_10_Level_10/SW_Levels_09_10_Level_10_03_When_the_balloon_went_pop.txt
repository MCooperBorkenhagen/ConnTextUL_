When the Balloon Went Pop!

Little Tommy Spot
had some balloons.

One of the balloons went "pop!"

When the balloon went "pop,"
Mrs. Spot got scared
and dropped the coffee pot.

When Mrs. Spot
dropped the coffee pot,
Mr. Spot got scared
and fell out of his chair.

When Mr. Spot fell out of 
his chair, the parrot
got scared and screamed.

When the parrot screamed,
the cat got scared
and jumped at the dog.

When the cat 
jumped at the dog,
the dog got scared
and ran across the room.

When the dog ran across
the room, it bit one of Tommy
Spot's balloons.

Pop!
