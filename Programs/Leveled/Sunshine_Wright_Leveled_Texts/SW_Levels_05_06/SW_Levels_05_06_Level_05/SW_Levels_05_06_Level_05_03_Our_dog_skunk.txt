Our Dog, Skunk.

Our dog, Skunk, 
likes to play.

In spring, she likes to play
in the grass.

In summer, she likes to play
in the pool.

In fall, she likes to play
in the leaves.

In winter, she likes to play
in the snow.

Sometimes, our dog, Skunk,
likes to play in the garbage.

That is why
we call her "Skunk."
