The Little Bird.

I found a little bird.
It would not sing.

I gave it a cage.
It would not sing.

I gave it some food.
It would not sing.

I gave it some water.
It would not sing.

I gave it a bell.
It would not sing.

"Little bird! Little bird!
Please, will you sing!"

I let the little bird
out of the cage.
It sang and sang and sang.
