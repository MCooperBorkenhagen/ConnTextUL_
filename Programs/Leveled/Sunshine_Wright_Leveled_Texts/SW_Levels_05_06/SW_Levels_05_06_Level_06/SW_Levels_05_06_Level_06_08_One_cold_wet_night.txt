One cold, wet night.

One cold, wet night, the farmer got out of bed.
Farmer went outside.  Then the horse jumped into the bed.
The horse said, I'm going to be warm tonight.
The cow jumped into the bed.  The cow said, I'm going to be warm tonight.
The sheep jumped into the bed.  The sheep said, I'm going to be warm tonight.
The dog jumped into the bed.  The dog said, I'm going to be warm tonight.
A giant weta jumped into the bed.
The farmer came back.
Get out of my bed! He yelled.
The horse ran out.
Skiddle-dee-doo.
The cow ran out.
Skiddle-dee-doo.
The sheep ran out.
Skiddle-dee-doo.
The dog ran out.
Skiddle-dee-doo.
But the giant weta stayed in the bed.
And the farmer said, I'll sleep on the couch tonight.
