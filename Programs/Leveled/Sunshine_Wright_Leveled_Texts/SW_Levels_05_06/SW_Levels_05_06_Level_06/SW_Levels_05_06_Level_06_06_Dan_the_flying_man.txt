Dan the flying man.

I am Dan, the flying man.Catch me, catch me if you can.Over a houseAnd over a crane,Over a bridge,And over a train.Over flowers,Over trees,Over mountains,Over seas.I am Dan, the flying man.Catch me, catch me, if you can.All the people ran and ran.They caught Dan the flying man.
