Woosh!  I had a little rooster, I fed him on dough.  He got so fat that he could not crow.I had a little dog, His name was Dandy.  His tail was long, and his legs were bandy.I had a little donkey, His name was Jay.  I pulled his tail to hear him bray.I had a little donkey, His name was Dick.  I pulled his tail to see him kick.That little donkey kicked so high, I went right up and touched the sky.I had a little billy-goat, His name was Toot.He chewed my washing, and he chewed my boot.  I had a little horse, he was made of hay.  A big wind came and blew him away.Woosh!
