Goodbye, Lucy.

Goodbye, Lucy.
Oops. I forgot something.
Mom, I forgot my book.
Here it is. 
Goodbye, Lucy.
Goodbye, Mom.
Oops. I forgot something.
Mom. Mom.
I forgot my lunch.
Goodbye, Lucy.
Goodbye, Mom.
Oops. Mom, I forgot something.
What?
You have your bag.
You have your book.
You have your lunch.
What is it?
I know.
I forgot my goodbye hug.
