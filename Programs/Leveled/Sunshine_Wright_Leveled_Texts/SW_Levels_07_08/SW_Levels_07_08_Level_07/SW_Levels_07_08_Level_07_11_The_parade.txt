The Parade.

In the parade,
I saw a drummer drumming,
and as he drummed,
he smiled at me.

In the parade,
I saw a marcher marching,
and as she marched,
she smiled at me.

In the parade,
I saw a juggler juggling,
and as he juggled,
he smiled at me.

In the parade,
I saw a dancer dancing,
and as she danced,
she smiled at me.

In the parade,
I saw a rider riding,
and as he rode,
he smiled at me.

The rider was my Dad,
and he put me on his horse!

In the parade,
I rode with my Dad,
and as I rode,
I smiled at everyone.
