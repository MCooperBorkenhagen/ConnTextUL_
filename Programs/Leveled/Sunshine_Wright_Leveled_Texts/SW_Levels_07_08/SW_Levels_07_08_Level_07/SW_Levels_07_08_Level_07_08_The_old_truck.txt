The Old Truck.

Tom and Bill went for a ride
in the old truck.

The spare wheel came off.
"We don't need the spare wheel,"
Tom said.

The mirror came off.
"We don't need the mirror,"
Tom said.

The fender came off.
"We don't need the fender,"
said Tom.

The door came off.
"We don't need the door,"
said Tom.

Then ...
the steering wheel came off.
"We need a steering wheel!"
said Bill.

"Yes," said Tom.
"We need a steering wheel!"
