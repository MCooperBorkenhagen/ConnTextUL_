Talking Feet.

When Martians walk,
their feet say, "One! Two! Three!"

When Martians run,
their feet say, "Go! Go! Go!"

When Martians come to a rock,
their feet say, "Stop!"

Then their feet say, "Climb!"

When Martians dance,
their feet sing.

When Martians dance
and dance and dance,
their feet say ...

"Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!"
