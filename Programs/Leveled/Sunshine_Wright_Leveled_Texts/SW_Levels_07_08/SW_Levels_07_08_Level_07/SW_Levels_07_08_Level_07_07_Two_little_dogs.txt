Two Little Dogs.

Look! The door's open. That's good. Look! The gate's open. That's good. The two little dogs ran after a cat.They ran after a bird. They ran after a mouse. They ran after a rabbit. Look!  A big, big dog.That's bad, they said. We won't run after him. And they didn't.He ran after them all the way home. Look!  The gate's open.  That's good. Look!  The door's open.  That's good.
