The Penguins.

The penguins walk on the ice.

They slide on the ice.

The penguins dive
into the water.
They look for fish to eat.

The killer whales come.

The killer whales
look for penguins to eat!

The penguins swim.
The penguins swim
faster and faster!

The penguins
jump onto the ice.
They are safe!
