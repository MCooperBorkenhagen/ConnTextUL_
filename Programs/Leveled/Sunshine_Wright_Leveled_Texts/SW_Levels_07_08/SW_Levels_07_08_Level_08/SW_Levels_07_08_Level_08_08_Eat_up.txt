Eat Up!

Mom says
if I eat up my potatoes
I'll get hair on my chest.

Dad says
if I eat up my meat
I'll get big and strong.

Grandpa says
if I eat up my carrots
I'll be able to see in the dark.

Grandma says
if I eat up my spinach
I'll get big muscles.

My brother says
if I eat up my crusts
I'll get curly hair.

My sister says
if I eat up my lettuce
I'll turn into a rabbit.

So -
if I eat up all my dinner,
what will I look like?
