Meg.

We were out in the boat
with our dog, Meg.

A storm came up.
"We have to go home,"
said Dad.

On the way home
Dad said to us,
"Where is Meg?"

Meg was not in the boat.

We went back
and looked for Meg.
"Meg! Meg!" we called.
Meg was not there.

"We have to go home now,"
said Dad.

"Please, Dad," we said.
"One more look.
We haven't looked
on that rock."

We went to the rock.
We called, "Meg! Meg! Meg!"

"Do I hear a dog barking?"
said Dad.

Then we saw a wet dog
wagging a wet tail.
It was Meg.
