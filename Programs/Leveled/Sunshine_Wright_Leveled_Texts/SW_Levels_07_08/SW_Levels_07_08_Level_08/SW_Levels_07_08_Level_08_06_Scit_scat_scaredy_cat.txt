Scit, Scat, Scaredy Cat!

Scit, scat, scaredy cat,
why are you running away?

Growl, scowl, old wise owl,
why are you running away?

Grrr, grrr, big brown bear,
why are you running away?

Hiss, siss, long black snake,
why are you running away?

Crick, crock, crocodile,
why are you running away?

Rumble, rumble
through the jungle ...
why are you running away?

Squeak, squeak ...
Eeeeek! A mouse!
