I Smell Smoke!

I smell smoke!
Get down on the floor!

I smell smoke!
How hot is the door?

I smell smoke!
Crawl down the hall!

I smell smoke!
Stay by the wall!

I smell smoke!
Quick! Go outside!

I smell smoke!
"Help! Help!" I cry.

I smell smoke!
Dad's cooking tonight!

If you smell
smoke, get out
safe, like me!
