Auntie Maria and the Cat.

When we went to stay 
with Auntie Maria,
we took our cat.

"I don't like cats,"
said Auntie Maria.

Auntie Maria saw the cat
asleep on her chair.

"No, no, no!" she yelled.
"No cats on that chair!"

The cat got on the shelf.
He went to sleep
on the clock.

"No!" yelled Auntie Maria.
"No cats on the clock!"

Auntie Maria's hat
was on her bed.
The cat got in the hat.

"My hat!" yelled Auntie Maria.
"Out! Out! Out!
No cats in hats!"

Auntie Maria looked at us.
"I don't like cats!" she said.

But ...
the cat liked Auntie Maria.

And Auntie Maria
began to like the cat.
