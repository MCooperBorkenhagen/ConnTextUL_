Mrs. Wishy-Washy.
Oh, lovely mud, said the cow,
And she jumped in it.
Oh, lovely mud, said the pig and he rolled in it.
Oh, lovely mud, said the duck, and she paddled in it.
Along came Mrs. Wishy-washy.
Just look at you!  She screamed.
In the tub you go.
In went the cow, wishy-washy, wishy-washy.
In went the pig, wishy-washy, wishy-washy.
In went the duck, wishy-washy, wishy-washy.
That's better, said Mrs. Wishy-Washy, and she went into the house.
Away went the cow.
Away went the pig.
Away went the duck.
Oh, lovely mud, they said.
