Little Monkey is stuck.Little Monkey liked to climb 
in the trees.  
"Look at me," 
he said.  
"I can climb up the tree."
"Be careful," 
said Mother Monkey.  
"You are only a little monkey.""I'll be careful,"
said Little Monkey. He went on climbing 
up the tree.  

Little Monkey climbed 
to the top of the tree.  
"I can see a long way,"
he said.  
"I can see Big Giraffe eating leaves.  
She is eating her lunch."
"Look at me, Big Giraffe!" 
he yelled.  
"I'm up here in the tree!"Big Giraffe went on munching the leaves. 
She didn't look at Little Monkey.
"I'm hungry, too,"
said Little Monkey.
"I'll go home now."

Little Monkey looked down.
It was a long way down
to the bottom of the tree.
He couldn't see Mother Monkey.
He was frightened.

He started to climb down the tree.
Halfway down the tree,
his tail got stuck in a branch.
He pulled at his tail,
but he couldn't get it free.
He pulled and pulled,
but it was stuck!

"Ow, ow, ow!" he yelled.
"Help me, help me!
I'm stuck in the tree."

No one came to help Little Monkey.
He was all by himself.
He looked down the tree,
but he couldn't see Mother Monkey.
He was frightened.
"Help me, please help me,"
he said.

"I can help you,"
said Big Giraffe.
She pulled the branch down,
and Little Monkey was free.
"Thank you, Big Giraffe,"
said Little Monkey.
"Thank you for helping me.
I can go home now."
