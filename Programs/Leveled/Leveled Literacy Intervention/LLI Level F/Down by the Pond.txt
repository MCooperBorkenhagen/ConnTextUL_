Down by the Pond:
A bird is flying down by the pond.The bird flies to its nest.The bees are buzzing down by the pond.They look for flowers.Bees get food from flowers.The frogs are hopping down by the pond.They look for bugs to eat.The turtle is crawling down by the pond.It crawls out of the water.It lays its eggs in the ground.The snake is sliding down by the pond.It slides into the grass.It looks for mice to eat.A mouse is running down by the pond.He hides in the grass.He hides from the snake.The bird and the bees, the frogs and the turtles, the snake and the mouse are down by the pond.
