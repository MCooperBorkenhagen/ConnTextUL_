Grandma's Glasses.My grandma had lots of flower seeds."Let's plant the seeds," she said."Where are my glasses?" Grandma asked."I need them to read about the seeds.""Here are your glasses!" I said.Grandma put on her glasses.Then she read about the seeds.She read how to plant them."Let's go to the garden," said Grandma."You can help me plant the seeds."Grandma got her hat.And I got all the seeds."Let's plant the sunflower seeds," I said."How deep will we plant them?""Let's check the pack of seeds," said Grandma."Will you get my glasses?They must be on the table."I went inside.I looked on the table.I looked on the chairs.I looked for a long time.But I couldn't find Grandmas' glasses.Grandma came back inside."Did you find my glasses?" she asked."Not yet," I said."I'll look with you," said Grandma.We looked on the table.We looked on the chairs.We looked for a long time.But we just could not find Grandma's glasses anywhere.Then Grandma sat down and took off her hat."Grandma!" I said."I found your glasses!"
