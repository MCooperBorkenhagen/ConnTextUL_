The Three Little Pigs and a Big Bad Wolf.
Once there were three little pigs.
They needed new homes.
The first little pig made his house out of straw.
What a fine house! he said.
The second little pig made her house out of sticks.
What a fine house! she said.
The third little pig made his house out of bricks.
What a fine house! he said.
One day a big bad wolf came to the straw house.
Let me in, little pig! he said.
No! said the first little pig.
Then I'll huff and puff and blow your house down, said the big bad wolf.
And he did.
The little pig ran away to his sister's stick house.
The next day the big bad wolf went to the stick house.
Let me in, little pigs! he said.
No! said the second little pig.
Then I'll huff and puff and blow your house down! said the big bad wolf.
And he did.
The little pigs ran away to their brother's brick house.
The next day the big bad wolf went to the brick house.
Let me in, little pigs! he said.
No! said the third little pig.
Then I'll huff and puff and blow your house down! said the big bad wolf.
And he tried.
The big bad wolf huffed and he puffed.
But he could not blow the brick house down!
So the big bad wolf came up with a plan.
Down, down, down he went!
But the three little pigs had a plan, too.
Hello, wolf! they said.
Splash!
The big bad wolf ran away.
And the three little pigs lived happily ever after!
