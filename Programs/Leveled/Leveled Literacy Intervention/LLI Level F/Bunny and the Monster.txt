Bunny and the Monster.
One day the Rabbits went for a ride.
Stop! said Grandma.
Dad said, You can go for a hop, little Rabbits.
But do not go far!
Bunny and Sunny and Jack went for a hop.
They hopped under a fence.
Who is there? said Bunny.
It's a monster! said Sunny.
Run! said Jack.
Bunny hopped into a hole.
She saw a pink monster.
Sunny hopped behind a bush.
She saw a black and white monster.
Jack hopped in the tall grass.
He saw a long monster with lots of hair!
Bunny, Sunny, and jack hopped back to the car.
At home, they made pictures of the monster.
It looked like this! said Bunny.
No, said Sunny.
It looked like this!
No, no, said Jack.
It looked like this!
Did we see three monsters? said Bunny.
She looked and looked at the pictures.
She made some lines.
Look! said Bunny.
We saw the same monster.
But it was not a monster at all!
