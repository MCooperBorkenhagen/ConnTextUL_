Pictures of Hugs.
It was Pet Week at school.
Meg had to take a picture of Hugs to share.
She got her crayons and some paper.
This picture doesn't look like Hugs, she said.
Meg got more paper.
But she could not make a good picture of her cat.
Do you want my camera? Gram said.
I can show you how to use it.
Yes! said Meg.
Hugs was playing with a toy mouse.
Meg leaned over.
Click!
She took a picture.
But Hugs moved.
That's not Hugs! Meg said.
That's my shoe. 
Click!
Meg took a picture.
But Hugs moved again.
That's his tail, Meg said.
This picture is not good.
Hugs chased his mouse all around the room.
And Meg chased Hugs.
Click! Click! Click!
Meg took more pictures.
But it was hard to take a good picture of Hugs.
He moved every time!
These pictures are not good, Meg said.
But maybe I can use them all at once, like a puzzle!
She printed the pictures, and she put them side by side.
But that didn't work.
Do you want me to help? Gram asked.
I can take a picture of Hugs for you.
Where is Hugs? Meg asked.
Then she saw him.
She held up the camera.
Click!
She took a picture.
Look, Gram, Meg said.
It's not hard to take a picture of Hugs when he is sleeping!
