But she did not like Blue Bird's home.The tree was too high.No, thanks, said Little Wolf.A tree is not the right home for me.So Little Wolf went to see her friend, Bear.Hi, Bear, said Little wolf.I am looking for a new home.Well, said Bear.A cave is a good home.Little Wolf liked Bear.But Bear's home was too dark.No, thanks, said Little Wolf.A cave is not the right home for me.Little Wolf walked on and on.She walked by a river.Hello, Little Wolf, said Fish.Hello, Fish, Little Wolf said.But Little Wolf kept walking.She did not like Fish's home.The river was too wet!Little Wolf walked all day.Soon it was dark.Little Wolf was cold and very sleepy.She thought about the warm, safe den with her brothers and sisters.Little Wolf ran home.I don't need a bigger, better home, she said.My home is just right!
