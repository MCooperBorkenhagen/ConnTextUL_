The Coyote and the Rabbit:
Long ago, Coyote met Rabbit in the desert.I can run as fast as the wind, Coyote bragged. 
I am the fastest animal.I can run fast, too, said Rabbit.Let's have a race, said Coyote.  
I am faster than you. 
So I will win the race.Rabbit wanted to win. 
But he knew Coyote ran faster.So Rabbit asked his brothers for help.Help me trick Coyote, said Rabbit. 
Then I can win the race.The race was the next day.Rabbit said, I will run underground.That is fine. 
I run faster than you, bragged Coyote.  
So I will win.The race began.Coyote dashed off. 
Rabbit jumped into a hole.Coyote ran very fast.Then he stopped to rest.A rabbit came out of a hole ahead of him.It was one of Rabbit's brothers. 
But Coyote didn't know that.Coyote ran faster.Then he stopped to rest.A rabbit came out of a hole ahead of him.It was another one of Rabbit's brothers. 
But Coyote didn't know that.Coyote ran even faster. 
Then he stopped to rest again.A rabbit came out of a hole ahead of him.It was another one of Rabbit's bothers. 
But Coyote didn't know that.So Coyote ran. He ran as fast as the wind.Rabbit ran, too. He ran out of the last hole. 
Coyote saw Rabbit win the race.Rabbit and his brothers laughed and laughed.And Coyote never bragged again!
