Dinner for Maisy:Maisy loved to eat.Every day at dinner, she ran to her dish.She ate all her food and begged for more.Every day was the same.Until one day Dana put food in Maisy's dish.Maisy just looked at her food.She didn't eat one bite."Eat your dinner," Dana said.But Maisy wouldn't eat.The next day, Nate put out food for Maisy.Maisy looked at the food in her dish.But she still wouldn't eat."Eat your dinner, Maisy," Nate said.Maisy just sniffed the food and walked away.Nate and Dana were upset."Why won't Maisy eat?" Nate asked."She must be sick," said Dana."Don't worry," said Dad."We'll take Maisy to the vet."Maisy wagged her tail when she saw Dr. Grant."What's the matter?" Dr. Grant asked."Maisy won't eat," said Dana."And you know Maisy.She loves to eat!"Dr. Grant checked Maisy."Maisy has gained three pounds," said the doctor."She must be eating something!"They took Maisy home.At dinner, she still wouldn't eat."Maybe this food is too old," Dad said."There are some new bags of dog food in the basement."Nate and Dana went to get a new bag of dog food."Oh, no!" said Nate."Look at all the dog food that came out of the bags!"Dana smiled."I know who did it," she said."Me too!" said Nate."Maisy!" called Nate and Dana.
