The Skunk with No Stripes:Three baby skunks lived with their mother."Look at me," said Brother Skunk."I have soft, black fur.I have a long, bushy tail.I have two white stripes down my back.""Look at me," said Sister Skunk."I have soft, black fur.I have a long, bushy tail.I have two white stripes down my back."Little Skunk looked at Brother and Sister.He said, "I have soft, black fur.I have a long, bush tail.But I do not have white stripes down my back."Brother Skunk said,"All skunks have stripes.You do not have stripes, so maybe you are not a skunk.""Look at the cat," said Sister Skunk."She has soft, black fur and a bush tail.But she has no stripes.Maybe you are a cat.""Am I a cat?" Little Skunk asked."No," said the cat."You do not purr, so you are a not a cat.""Look at that squirrel," said the cat."He has soft, black fur and a bushy tail.But he has no stripes.Maybe you are a squirrel.""Am I a squirrel?" Little Skunk asked."No," said the squirrel."You can not run up a tree, so you are not a squirrel.""Look at that bear," said the squirrel."He has soft, black fur.But he has no stripes.Maybe you are a bear.""That bear has a short, stubby tail," said Little Skunk."I have a long, bushy tail. I am not a bear."The bear followed Little Skunk home."Go away!" cried Little Skunk."Or I will spray you with a stinky smell.""You do not look like a skunk," said the bear."You can not spray me."Little Skunk raised his long, bushy tail.Then he sprayed a stinky smell on the bear.The bear roared, "Oh, no!You are a skunk!"Then he ran away."Wow!" said Little Skunk."I sprayed a yucky, stinky smell on that bear.Stripes or no stripes, I am a skunk for sure!"
