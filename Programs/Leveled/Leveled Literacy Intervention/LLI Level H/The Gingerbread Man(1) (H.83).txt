The Gingerbread Man:Once upon a time, a little old woman and a little old man lived deep in the woods.One day, the little old woman said, "Let's make a gingerbread man."So they made the gingerbread, and they cut out a man.The little old woman gave the gingerbread man two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.Then she put him inside the oven to bake."I'm hungry!" said the little old man."Is the gingerbread man ready to eat?""I'll look," said the little old woman.The little old woman peeked inside the oven.The gingerbread man jumped out."You can't eat me!" he cried.And he ran away."Come back!" cried the little old woman."Come back!" cried the little old man.Then the little old woman and the little old man ran after the gingerbread man.The gingerbread man ran and ran.He laughed and said, "Run run as fast as you can!You can't catch me.I'm the gingerbread man!"Down the road, the gingerbread man met a hungry pig."Stop! Stop!" cried the pig."I want to eat you!"But the gingerbread man laughed and said,"Run, run, as fast as you can!You can't catch me.I'm the gingerbread man!I ran away from the little old woman.I ran away from the little old man.And I can run away from you.I can! I can!Down the road, the gingerbread man met a hungry cow."Stop! Stop!" cried the cow."You look good to eat!"But the gingerbread man laughed and said,"Run, run, as fast as you can!You can't catch me.I'm the gingerbread man!I ran away from the little old woman.I ran away from the little old man.I ran away from the pig.And I can run away from you.I can! I can!The gingerbread man came to a river."Oh, no!" he cried."How will I get across?"Then the gingerbread man saw a fox."I can take you across," said the sly fox."Jump on my tail.""No! You will eat me up," said the gingerbread man."No, I won't," said the sly fox."Jump on my tail."So the gingerbread man jumped on the fox's tail."I'm getting wet," said the gingerbread man."Jump on my back," said the sly fox."You will stay dry there."The gingerbread man jumped on the fox's back."I am getting wet," said the gingerbread man."Jump on my nose," said the sly fox."You will stay dry there."The gingerbread man jumped.He jumped right into the fox's mouth!"Yum!" said the sly fox.And that was the end of the gingerbread man!
