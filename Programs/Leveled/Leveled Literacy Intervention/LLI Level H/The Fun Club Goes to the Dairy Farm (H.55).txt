The Fun Club Goes to the Dairy Farm.
I ran out of milk, Miss Dimple said, but I will get more today. 
We're going on a field trip. 
Where are we going? Asked Keb. 
We're going to see where milk comes from, said Miss Dimple. 
A supermarket? Keb asked. 
No! Said Miss Dimple. 
A dairy farm! 

They went to Mr. Moody's dairy farm. 
Mr. Moody showed them his cows. 
Cows give us milk, said Mr. Moody. 
And cheese, butter, and ice cream are all made from milk. 
That cow looks like he's chewing gum! Said Rich. 
She! Said Mr. Moody. 
All these milk cows are females. 
Cows burp up grass in little lumps called cud. 
Then they chew it again. 
These girls chew their cud all day. 
My cows also eat corn and food pellets, Mr. Moody said. 
Cows need good food to make good milk! 
I milk every cow two times a day, send Mr. Moody. 
Come and see the milking parlor. 
The cows sleep in the barn, Mr. Moody said. 
But we milk them here. 
We wear booties on our shoes in the milking parlor. 
We need to keep it very clean. 
I can milk six cows an hour, Mr. Moody said. 
But a machine can milk 100 cows in an hour. 
Thank you for my milk, Keb told a cow. 
I'm glad you like it, said Mr. Moody. 
Now, who wants to help me clean out the barn?
