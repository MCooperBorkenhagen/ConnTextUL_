The Boss:
It was Sunday morning.Mom was sick in bed.Mom needs more orange juice, Dad said. 
I'll go to the store and get some for her. 
I'll be right back. 
Be good while I'm gone.Dad is gone, said my big brother. 
Now I'm the boss. 
I want to be the boss, said my little sister.We can take turns. You go first, I told my big brother.OK, he said.  
Let's make breakfast for Mom. 
Let's make her some toast. 
I put peanut butter on the toast. 
My brother put grape jelly on top. 
Then my sister added chocolate chips. Mom can eat the toast when she wakes up, said my brother.Now it's my turn to be the boss, I said. 
Let's make a card for Mom.My brother got some paper, and I got the paint. 
We wrote, Get Well, Mom.My sister painted flowers. 
She got some blue paint on the card. 
She got some blue paint in her hair.My turn! Said my little sister. 
Now I'm the boss. 
I want balloons for Mom.My brother and I just smiled. 
Our little sister loved balloons.My brother got a balloon and blew it up.Bigger! My sister shouted.So he blew some more. 
He blew and blew until POP!My sister screamed.Oh, no! I said.Mom woke up. 
She came running into the room.What's going on? Mom asked. We took turns being the boss, I said.I see, said Mom.Mom saw the toast and the card. 
She saw the popped balloon. 
Then Mom saw her sister's blue hair.Mom laughed and laughed.  
Now I'm the boss, she said.Let's clean up this mess!
