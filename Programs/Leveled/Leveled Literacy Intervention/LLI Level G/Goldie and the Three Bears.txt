Goldie and the Three Bears.One day, Goldie went for a walk in the woods.Soon she came to a little house.The door was open."Hello," called Goldie.But no one answered."I wonder who lives here," said Goldie."I think I'll go inside."And she did.Goldie was hungry from her walk.She saw three bowls of soup on the table.She tried them all."This soup is too hot," said Goldie."This soup is too cold," said Goldie."This soup is just right," said Goldie.So Goldie ate the soup.And soon it was all gone.Goldie was cold from her walk.She saw three chairs by the fireplace.She tried them all."This chair is too high," said Goldie."This chair is too low," said Goldie."This chair is just right," said Goldie.So Goldie sat on the chair.And she broke it.Goldie was sleepy and wanted a nap.She saw three beds in the bedroom.She tried them all."This bed is too soft," said Goldie."This bed is too hard," said Goldie."This bed is just right," said Goldie.So Goldie lay down on the bed.And she fell asleep.Just then, the three bears came home.Baby Bear was hungry from his walk.So he got his soup bowl."My soup is all gone!" cried Baby Bear."Who ate my soup?""I don't know," said Mama Bear.Baby Bear was cold from his walk.So he went to his chair by the fireplace."My chair is all broken!" cried Baby Bear."Who broke my chair?" "I don't know," said Papa Bear.Baby Bear was sleepy and wanted a nap.So he went to his bed."Someone is sleeping in my bed!" cried Baby Bear."Who is that?""I don't know," said Mama Bear."It's a little girl," said Papa Bear."And she's fast asleep!"Goldie woke up when she heard the three bears.She jumped out of bed."Eek!" cried Goldie."Eek!" cried the three bears.Goldie ran out of the house.She ran all the way home as fast as she could.She gave her mother a big hug and kiss.And she never went back to the little house again!
