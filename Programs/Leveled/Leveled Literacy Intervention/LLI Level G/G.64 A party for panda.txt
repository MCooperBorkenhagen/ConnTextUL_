A Party for Panda:
Here is a panda cub.This baby panda was born at a zoo.The cub was very, very small when  she  was  born.She was only  as big as a  stick of butter!She had pink skin and just a little white fur.The mother panda held the cub  in her arms. 
She fed her cub. 
The vets at the zoo checked the panda cub. 
They checked her as she grew and grew.Now the cub  has black fur on her ears and around her eyes.She has black fur on her arms and legs, too.The mother  panda shows her cub how to play and how to climb trees.She shows her cub good plants to eat.Many people come  to the zoo to see  the panda cub. 
They  see her play and climb  trees.They see her eat, too. 
Today, there is a big party at the  zoo.The  party is for the cub's first birthday! 
Happy birthday, panda  cub!
