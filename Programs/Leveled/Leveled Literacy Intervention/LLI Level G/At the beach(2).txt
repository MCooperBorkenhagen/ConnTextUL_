At the beach:
I am going to the beach, Papa said.Who wants to come?I do, said Sam.I do, too, said Jesse.But I have two more pages to read in my book.What book are you reading? Papa asked.It's a good book, Jess said.It's about sharks.Sharks can eat people, Sam said.The book didn't say that, Jess said.Are there sharks at our little beach, Papa? Jess asked.There are small sharks, Papa said.They are small but they have sharp teeth, Sam told Jesse.At the little beach, Papa read his book.Sam jumped in the waves.Jesse didn't want to go in the water.He didn't want a shark to eat him up.But it was very hot.Jesse looked at Sam.Sam was having fun.Jesse couldn't see any sharks, so he went in the water, too.He jumped in the waves.Did you see any sharks, Sam? Jesse asked.Sam didn't say anything.Jesse looked for Sam, but he couldn't see him.Papa was on the beach, but where was Sam?Maybe a shark got him!Just then, something grabbed, Jesse's toe!Jesse jumped.Was it a shark?No, it was Sam!No shark will get you here! Sam said.But I can get you!I can get you, too, Jess said.And Jesse and Sam played shark for the rest of the day.
