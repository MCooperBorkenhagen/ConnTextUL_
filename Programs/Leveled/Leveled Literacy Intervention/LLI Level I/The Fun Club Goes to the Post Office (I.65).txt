The Fun Club Goes to the Post Office.
Miss Dimple took her Fun Club to the post office.Let's mail these letters, she said.I need three stamps, Miss Dimple said to a worker.Miss Dimple put the stamps on her letters.Then she put the letters in a slot.Where are the letters now? asked Rich.Here they are, said the worker. 
They are here in the bin. The bin is for letters in zip code 04021.This is the zip code for our town, Miss Dimple said. 
All the mail with that zip code goes to people in this town.What happens next? Asked Keb. 
We put marks on the stamp, said the worker. 
The marks show when and where the letter was mailed.Then a worker sorts all the letters and the other mail into piles, said Miss Dimple.How do people get their letters? Asked Dana.Some people have mailboxes here in the post office, said the worker.The worker showed them a truck. 
Some people have mailboxes at their houses, she said. 
Mail trucks take the letters to them.What happens to the mail that is not staying in our town? Asked Rich.That mail goes to a big building, said the worker. 
Machines sort the letters. Then the letters go to mailboxes all over the world!Look in  your mailboxes tomorrow, Miss Dimple said. 
You may get a surprise.And they did!
