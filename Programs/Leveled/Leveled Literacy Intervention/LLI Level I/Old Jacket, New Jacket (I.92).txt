Old Jacket, New Jacket.
Mom held up a faded blue jacket. 
"This jacket looks like it will fit you, Iris," said Mom. 
Iris looked at the jacket. 
It was her sister's old jacket. 
Dana always wore it with her jeans. 
 Iris shook her head. 
"I don't want that old thing," said Iris. 
"I want a new jacket to wear with my jeans." 
"But this is a good jacket," said Mom. 
"It will look good on you, Iris." 
At first, Iris felt sad. 
Then she felt mad. 
Dana's old jacket was not the same as a new one. 
Iris wanted a jacket that was just for her. 
Iris stared at the jacket. 
She wanted to make it special. 
What could she do? 
She put a heart pin on it. 
That didn't look right. 
But the pin gave Iris an idea. 
"Mom, can I use some things in your sewing box?" Iris asked. 
"Sure," said Mom. 
Iris opened the sewing box. 
She took out some red cloth and some white cloth. 
She cut the red cloth shape of a heart. 
Oh, I see what You are doing," her mom said. 
"Do you want some help?" 
 "Yes, please," said Iris. 
"I want red hearts and white stars." 
"Okay," said Mom. 
"You cut out the hearts. 
I'll sew them on." 
Iris cut out three red hearts. 
Her mom put one heart on the back of the jacket. 
She put two hearts on the front of the jacket. 
 Then Mom cut out lots of stars. 
She put them on the front of the jacket and on the back, too. 
Iris looked at the jacket and started to feel happy! 
Mom took some gold beads out of a jar. 
Would you like some beads on your jacket?" she asked. 
 
 "Oh, yes!" said Iris. 
"Red hearts and white stars and gold beads. 
That will be beautiful!" 
Here is your new jacket, Mom said to Iris at last. 
Iris put on the jacket. 
She looked at the back, and she looked at the front. 
She liked what she saw. 
Iris loved her new jacket. 
 Just then Dana came in. 
"Nice jacket!" said Dana. 
"Can I have one, too?" she asked Mom. 
"It's easy," said Iris. 
"Just get an old jacket and make it brand new!"
