The Fun Club Goes to the Vet Clinic.
Miss Dimple took Meatball to see the vet. 
Hi Meatball! Said Dr Grimes. 
Hi kids! 
Do you want to see the clinic? 
Let’s go! Said Miss Dimple. 
We keep pills and pet food here, Dr Grimes said. 
Some pets need our food or pills to stay well. 
The sick animals stay in these cages, said Dr Grimes. 
This dog broke his leg. 
But he will be okay. 
What is that? Rich asked. 
That’s an x-ray of a dog, Dr Grimes said. 
An x-ray is a picture of the inside of an animal or a person. 
Can you see the dog’s ribs? 
And that machine takes the x-ray pictures, said Miss Dimple. 
Is she looking at cat poo? Keb asked. 
Yes, said Dr Grimes. 
Kate is looking for little worms that can live in a pet’s tummy. 
Yuck! Said Dana. 
Dr Grimes smiled. 
We have pills for pets with worms, he said. 
Do you have an operating room? Keb asked. 
Yes. 
It’s down the hall, said Dr Grimes. 
Rich jumped on a scale. 
That’s the same number we get for a lot of dogs! Dr Grimes said. 
Dr Grimes took Meatball into a room. 
He put her on a table. 
He looked at her eyes and ears and teeth. 
He checked her heart. 
He pushed on her tummy. 
You need to feed Meatball a little more food now, Dr Grimes told Miss Dimple. 
Bring her back in two weeks. 
Is Meatball sick? Dana asked. 
No, said Dr Grimes. 
Meatball is fine. 
But she’s going to have puppies! He said.
