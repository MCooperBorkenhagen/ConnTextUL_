Road Builders:
This land is going to change.Soon a road will go across it.A road can not have trees on it.This big machine cuts trees down to make room for new roads.This machine cuts the trees up into little chips.This machine pushes rocks and tree stumps out of the way.Then it moves the dirt so a road can go in.It takes a lot of direct to make a road!This machine brings more dirt.And this machine puts the dirt in holes.A truck sprays water on the new road. The water wets down the dirt and dust.This machine packs the wet dirt to make it hard.The new road will be strong.It will hold up cars and trucks.Next, trumps dump gravel on the road.Gravel is little bits of rock.Machines push the gravel around and pack it down.This machine puts blacktop on roads.Blacktop is made with sand, gravel, and oil.A machine rolls over the blacktop.Then a truck paints lines on it.This road is done!Here come the cars and trucks!
