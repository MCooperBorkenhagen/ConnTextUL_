Fun for Hugs:
Gram was making a scarf for Meg.Hugs liked the yarn.He humped on it.Then he rolled over and over.Hugs was having fun!But Gram wasn't having any fun at all."Stop it, Hugs," said Gram."Go and see what Meg is doing."Meg was working on a puzzle.So hugs worked on the puzzle, too.He jumped on it.Then he pushed some puzzle pieces and watched them fall to the floor."Hugs! Stop! said Meg."I can't make this puzzle with you on top of it!"But Hugs was having too much fun to stop."Okay," said Meg."Forget the puzzle.I'll play the piano."Hugs liked that plan.Plunk! Plunk! PLONK!He played the piano, too."Hugs! No!" Meg said."Get off the piano.Go and see Gramps."Gramps was reading the paper, but Hugs wanted to play.Every time Gramps turned a page, Hugs jumped on it.Soon the paper was ripped to bits."Hugs needs something to do," said Meg."It's raining, so he can't play outside.""Well, we have to do something," said Gram."Yes! Just look at this paper," said Gramps."I know!" said Meg. "Let's make a new toy for Hugs.Then he can play with his toy, and we can watch a movie!"Meg, Gram, and Gramps all worked together to make a new toy for Hugs.They got an old toy mouse.Gram tied lots of yarn to it.Meg tied puzzle pieces to the yarn.Gramps added bits of paper and a bell."It's beautiful!" said Gram.Then Gramps made some popcorn.Gram started the movie.And Meg gave the new toy to Hugs."Look at this, Hugs," she said."Come on.Come and play with your new toy."But Hugs didn't want to play with the toy.Hugs wanted to watch the television!
