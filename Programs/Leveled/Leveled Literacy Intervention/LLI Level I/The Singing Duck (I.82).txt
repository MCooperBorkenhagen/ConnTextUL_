The Singing Duck.
Once there was a little duck. 
He was very happy to be a duck. 
He liked being a duck.  
He liked his webbed feet.  
They helped him swim as fast as a fish. 
He liked his sleek  feathers. 
They helped him stay warm when  he  got  wet.  
 He  liked his duck bill.
It helped  him  catch bugs and other good  things to eat.  
But there was one thing the little duck didn't like.  
He didn't like his quack.  
Why can't ducks sing like other birds? the duck asked his mother.  
All we do is quack, quack , quack!    
Quack !  said his mother. Quack, quack,  quack!  
   I want to make music,  the duck  said  to himself. 
Maybe I can learn to sing!    
So the duck left his pond. 
He waddled down a path on his webbed feet.  
  
He waddled under the trees.      
Bird songs filled the air.   
   The duck saw a bluebird in a bush. 
Tweet tweet tweet! sang the bird.  
Tweet tweet tweet!  
Hello, bird! said the duck. 
I like your song.  
Will you teach me to sing?    
The bluebird looked at the duck.  
  Well, thank you, she said. 
But why do you want to sing? 
You're a duck! 
Ducks quack.    
I don't want to quack, said the  duck  sadly. 
I want to make music. 
Please teach me to sing.  
The bluebird was a kind bird. 
She  wanted to help the little duck. 
All right, said  the  bluebird. 
She  lifted her head. 
She opened  her beak wide. 
She began to sing.     
Tweet tweet tweet! she sang. 
Now you try it!  
The duck lifted  his head. 
He opened his duck  duck bill wide.  
Quack! Quack! Quack! he sang. 
Quack, quack, quack, quack!  
Well,  said the bird. I see I was wrong. Ducks can sing! I have never  heard a duck sing as well as you!  That was quite true, because the bluebird had never heard a duck sing at all.  
 Are you sure? asked the duck. Was I really singing? 
It sounded like quacking to me.   
I'm sure  you were singing, said  the bird. 
You  were happy and you were singing. 
Your quack is your sing. 
Thank you, thank you!  quacked the duck.   
He waddled back to the pond as fast as his webbed feet could carry him.  
 And from then on, the duck loved everything about being a duck.
