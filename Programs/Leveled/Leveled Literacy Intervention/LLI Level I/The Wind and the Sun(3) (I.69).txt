The Wind and the Sun.
One day, Wind and Sun were bragging to each other. 
I am stronger than you, Wind bragged. 
When I blow, I can bend trees! 
I can turn umbrellas inside out! 
I am stronger than you, bragged Sun. 
When I shine, I make plants grow. 
I can melt snow and ice! 
How can we tell who is stronger? asked Sun. 
I have a great idea, said Wind. 
Let's have a contest. 
What kind of contest? asked Sun. 
Look at that traveler down there on the road, said Wind. 
He is wearing a coat. 
I will make his coat come off. 
I can blow it right off his back! 
Can you make his coat come off? 
I like that contest, said Sun. 
I'm sure I can make his coat come off. 
You go first, Sun said to Wind. 
I'll hide behind that cloud. 
Sun went behind a cloud to watch. 
Wind blew. 
Wind blew harder. 
Wind blew so hard that the man's hat came right off. 
But his coat did not come off. 
The man just grabbed his hat and tied it on tight. 
He put on his gloves, and he traveled on. 
Wind blew even harder. 
He blew as hard as he could. 
The man pulled his coat tighter around him, and he traveled on. 
Sun came out from behind the cloud. 
It's my turn now, he said. 
You will see how easy it is for me to make the man take off his coat. 
Sun looked down at the man and began to shine. 
It is so warm,  said the man. 
He took off his hat. 
Sun kept shining. 
Sun got very hot. 
The man got hotter and hotter. 
I feel really warm, said the man, and he took off his gloves. 
Sun got as hot as he could. 
It's much too warm to wear this coat, said the man, and he took off his coat. 
I win the contest! said Sun to Wind. 
I made the man take off his coat, so I am stronger than you. 
Yes, you are, agreed Wind. 
And he turned into a little breeze.
