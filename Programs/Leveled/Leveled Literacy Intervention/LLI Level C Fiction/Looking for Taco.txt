Looking for Taco.
Jack looked and looked for Taco.  
Taco! Come here! Jack said.
Jack looked in the yard.  
No, Taco was not under the rose bush.
Jack looked in the garage.  
No, Taco was not under the car.
He looked in the bathroom.  
No, Taco was not in the bathtub.
Jack looked in his bedroom.  
No, Taco was not under the bed.
He looked in mom's room.  
No, Taco was not under the desk.
Jack looked in the kitchen.  
He looked under the table.  
I see you, Taco! Jack said. 
And I see you, too, Orson!
