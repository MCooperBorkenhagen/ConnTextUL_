I'm a little frog.  
I can hop, too.
Look at me.  
I'm a little dog.

I'm a little cat.  
I can run, too.
Look at me. 
I'm a little bird.  
I can fly and fly.
Look at me.  
I'm a little duck.  
I can fly, too. 
Look at me.  
I'm a little fish.  
I can swim and swim and swim.
Look at us.  
Look at our puppet show!
