Baby Pictures.
Froggy went to Duck's house to play.
Duck was looking at some pictures.
This is my baby picture, said Duck.
I was a very cute baby duck.
Yes, you were a cute baby, said Froggy.
Froggy and Duck went to Otter's house.
Can we see your baby pictures? said Duck.
Here I am, said Otter.
I was a very cute baby otter.
Yes, you were, said Froggy.
Then Froggy and Duck and Otter went to Turtle's house.
Can we see your baby pictures? said Duck.
Here I am, said Turtle.
I was a cute, cute baby turtle.
Yes, you were, said Froggy.
All Froggy's friends had cute baby pictures. 
Froggy wanted to know what his baby pictures looked like.
So he went to ask his mom.
Mommy, was I a cute baby? Froggy asked.
Yes, yes, yes! his mom said.
You were a cute baby frog.
Can I see my baby pictures? Froggy asked.
Here is your baby book, said Froggy's mom.
Froggy looked at a picture.
He saw lots of baby frogs.
They looked like little fish.
Is that me? said Froggy.
It is me! Froggy said.
I was a cute little tadpole.
And now I am a very, very cute frog!
