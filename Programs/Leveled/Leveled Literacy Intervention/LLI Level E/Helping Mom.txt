Helping Mom.Mom got flowers for a garden.She said, "You can help me."I said, "Do I have to?I don't know how to plant flowers." But Mom said, "Come on.It will be fun."So I pushed and Mom pulled.It was hard work!"Let's put the flowers here," Mom said.I said, "These pots are too big." But Mom said, "You can do it!" Next I had to dig some holes.It was a big job!And it was not much fun.Then we had to put the flowers in the dirt.It was hot, but we had to keep working.Next we had to water the flowers.Mom said, "You can do that.It will be fun!The hose is over there."I got the hose.I turned it on."Mom! Help me!" I said."You can do it," Mom said."Just hold the hose like this."So I watered the flowers.I watered Mom, too!And that was a lot of fun!
