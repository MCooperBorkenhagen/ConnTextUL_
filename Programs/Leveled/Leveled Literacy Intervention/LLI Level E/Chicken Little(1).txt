Chicken Little.
Chicken Little was walking in the woods.Oh, no! said Chicken Little.The sky is falling! 
I will go to tell the king.So Chicken Little went to tell the king.Along came Henny Penny.The sky is falling, said Chicken Little.Oh, no! said Henny Penny.So Henny Penny and Chicken Little went to tell the king.Along came Ducky Lucky.The sky is falling, said Chicken Little.Oh, no! said Ducky Lucky.So Ducky Lucky and Henny Penny and Chicken Little went to tell the king.Along came Goosey Loosey.The sky is falling, said Chicken Little.Oh, no! said Goosey Loosey.So Goosey Loosey and Ducky Lucky and Henny Penny and Chicken Little went to tell the king.Along came Foxy Loxy.The sky is falling, said Chicken Little.Oh! Said Foxy Loxy.Let's look up at the sky.So Goosey Loosey and Ducky Lucky and Henny Penny and Chicken Little looked up at the sky.They looked and looked.Foxy Loxy looked at Goosey Loosey and Ducky Lucky and Henny Penny and Chicken Little.Maybe the sky is not falling, said Chicken Little.Oh! Said Henny Penny and Ducky Lucky and Goosey Loosey.  
The sky is not falling.So Chicken Little and Henny Penny and Ducky Lucky and Goosey Loosey looked at Foxy Loxy.Run! Said Chicken Little.Run! Said Henny Penny.Run! Said Ducky Lucky.Run! Said Goosey Loosey.They ran and ran.They ran all the way home.And they never did tell the king that the sky was falling.
