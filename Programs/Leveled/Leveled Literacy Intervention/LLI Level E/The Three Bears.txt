The Three Bears.
One day, a little girl went for a walk.  
She saw a house in the woods.  
She went in.  
No one was home.  
The little girl saw the three bowls.  
I like this one, she said. 
The little girl saw three chairs.  
I like this one, she said.
The little girl saw the three beds.  
I like this one, she said. 
The three bears came home.  
Mama Bear saw the bowls.  
Oh no! she said.  
Papa Bear saw the chairs.  
Oh no! he said.  
Baby Bear saw the little girl in his bed.  
He said, Oh no! 	
The little girls sat up.  
She saw the three bears.  
Oh no! she said.  
Then she ran all the way home.
