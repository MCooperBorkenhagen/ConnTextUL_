The Storm.A storm was coming.Bunny put her paws over her ears.She hid under her blanket.Little Bunny was scared."I want Hoppy," Bunny said."I want him to give me a big hug.Then I will not be scared."Hoppy was in his chair.Bunny got out of bed and went to get him.But the thunder went BAM!Bunny hopped back to bed.She hid under her blanket.Bunny peeked out at Hoppy.He was all by himself.His eyes were wide open.He looked scared.The thunder went Bam! Boom!"It is just a storm.It can't hurt you," Bunny said.But Hoppy looked scared."I can give you a big hug," Bunny said to Hoppy."A hug will make you feel better."Bunny ran to Hoppy.She ran very fast.Then she ran back.The thunder went Boom! Bam! BAM!But Bunny and Hoppy were not scared any more.
