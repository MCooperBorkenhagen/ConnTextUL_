The Trip.
I am going on a trip, said Duck.I love trips! Said Froggy.Where are you going?I am going to a big lake, said Duck.I love lakes! Said Froggy.What will you do there?I will swim in the lake, said Duck.And I will hike around the lake.I love to swim and hike, said Froggy.Let me help you pack your bag.Here is my bathing suit, said Duck.I will need a bathing suit if I go for a swim.Take your boots and socks, said Froggy.You will need them for your hike.I may go to a dance, said Duck.Let's pack this dress.I love to dance! Froggy said.Here. Take your red shoes, too.You will have so much fun on this trip! Said Froggy.I wish I could go with you.I wish you could, too, said Duck.Let's get your big bag, said Froggy.You have a lot to pack.Here is my hat, said Duck.And here is my umbrella.It's time to go.Froggy helped duck get to the bus stop.You get on the bus, said Froggy.I will put your bag in the back.Duck got on the bus.The bus took Duck all the way to the lake.Duck liked the lake very much.And so did Froggy!
