Ants on a Log.
The twins came home from school.
Hi, Dad, they said.
Can we have a snack?
Ok, said Dad.
What do you want to eat?
I want ice cream! Said Miguel.
I want candy! Said Rafael.
I know! Said Dad.
Let's make Ants on a log.
Yuck, said the twins.
We don't like ants.
Dad laughed.
You will like these ants, he said.
You can both help, Dad said.
Miguel can get the peanut butter.
Miguel got the jar of peanut butter.
Rafael can get the raisins, said Dad.
Rafael got the box of raisins.
I'll get the celery, Dad said.
Dad got the celery.
Dad washed the celery.
Then he cut it into long pieces.
What do we do now? Asked the twins.
Now we put the peanut butter on the celery, said Dad.
Can you do that, Miguel?
Sure, said Miguel.
I want to help, too, said Rafael.
You can help, said Dad.
You can put the raisins on top of the peanut butter.
Sure, said Rafael.
Ok, said Dad.
We're all done.
How does it look?
The celery looks like a log! Said Miguel.
The raisins look like ants! Said Rafael.
We like Ants on a log! Said the twins.
Just then Carmen came into the kitchen.
Hi, Carmen, said the twins.
We made a snack with Dad, said Miguel.
Do you want to try some yummy ants? Asked Rafael.
Ants! Said Carmen. Yuck!
The twins laughed.
You will like these ants! They said.
