Meli at the Vet.
Here is Meli.
Meli is Ron’s dog.
Meli is a West Highland terrier.
Meli is going to the vet with Ron.
A vet is a doctor for pets.
The vet looks at Meli’s fur.
She does not see any little fleas in her fur.
That’s good!
The vet looks at Meli’s eyes.
Her eyes look good!
The vet looks in Meli’s ears.
Her ears look good!
The vet looks at Meli’s teeth.
Meli’s teeth look good, too!
They are nice and clean.
The vet checks Meli’s heart.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
Meli’s heart is good and strong!
The vet gives Meli a shot.
Meli sits very still.
Good girl, Meli, the vet says.
Some pets do not like to go to the vet, but Meli likes it!
She gives the vet a big, wet kiss.
Then it is time for Meli to go home.
Meli likes that, too!
