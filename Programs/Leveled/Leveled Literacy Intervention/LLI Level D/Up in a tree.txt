Up in a Tree.
Hugs was up in a tree.  
Come down, Hugs, said Meg.  
But Hugs did not come down.
Meg got a toy.  
Come down, Hugs, Meg said. 
Come and get your toy.
But Hugs did not want the toy.  
He did not come down. 
Meg got a can of cat food.  
Come down, Hugs, said Meg.  
Come and eat your food.
But Hugs did not want the food.  
He did not come down. 
Hogs will not come down, said Meg.  
I will go up. 
And up she went. 
Meg and Hugs sat in the tree.  
Meg, said Gram. 
Come down and eat.
But Meg did not want to come down.
