The Pool.
Mouse was hot.
So she jumped into the pool.
Frog was hot, too.
He saw Mouse in the pool.
Is it cool in the pool? said Frog.
Yes, said Mouse.
Jump in.
Then Dog saw Mouse and Frog in the pool.
I am too hot, said Dog.
Jump into the pool, said Frog.
I am hot, too! said Pig.
Can I jump in with you?
Yes, said Mouse and Frog and Dog.
Goat looked at the pool.
I am hot, he said.
It looks cool in the pool.
Jump in, said Pig.
Cow saw the pool.
I am hot, Cow said.
I will jump in, too.
No! said Goat.
This pool is little, said Pig.
And you are big.
But Cow ran to the pool.
Stop! yelled Pig and Goat and Mouse.
Jump out! yelled Dog and Frog.
And they did!
