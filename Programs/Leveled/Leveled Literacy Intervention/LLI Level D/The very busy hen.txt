The Very Busy Hen.
Come and play, said the dog.  
No, said the hen. 
I am very busy. 
I am planting the wheat.
Come and play, said the cat.  
No, said the hen. 
I am very busy. 
I am watering the wheat.
Come and play, said the mouse.  
No, said the hen. 
I am very busy. 
I am cutting the wheat.
Come and play, said the horse.  
No, said the hen. 
I am very busy. 
I am mixing the bread.
Come and play, said the cow. 
No, said the hen. 
I am very busy. 
I am baking the bread.
Come and play, said the dog and the cat and the mouse and the horse and the cow.  
No, said the hen. 
Come and eat.
And they did.
