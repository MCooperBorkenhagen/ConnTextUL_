A Box.
We got a big box.
We put wheels on the box.
Now the box is a car.
We put plates and cups on the box.
Now the box is a table.
We made a sail for the box.
Now the box is a boat.
Then we got a new box.
We made a door and windows for the box.
Now the box is a house.
We made puppets for the box. 
Now the box is a stage.
Then we got a new box.
We made a top for the box.
We made windows, too.
Now this box is a rocket.
We made signs for the box.
Now this box is a store.
Now this box is a doghouse!
