What Am I?
I am in a tree.  
I swing from tree to tree.  
What am I?
I am in the grass.  
I can hide in the grass.  
What am I?
I am in the dirt.  
My home is under the ground.  
What am I?
I am in the sea.  
I can swim fast. 
What am I?
I am in a cave.  
I sleep here all day. 
What am I?
I am in the sand.  
I come out of the sea. 
What am I?
I am in the woods.  
I am eating the green leaves. 
What am I?
I am a monkey, a snake, an ant, a shark, a bat, a crab, a deer.
