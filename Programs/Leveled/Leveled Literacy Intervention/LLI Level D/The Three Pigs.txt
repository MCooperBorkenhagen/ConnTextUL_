The Three Pigs.
Let me in, said the wolf. 
No! said one little pig.
Then I will blow your house down, said the wolf.  
And he did. 
The little pig ran down the road. 
Let me in, said the wolf. 
No! said the two little pigs.
Then I will blow your house down, said the wolf.  
And he did. 
The two little pigs ran down the road. 
The wolf said, Let me in. 
No, no, no! said the three little pigs.
Then I will blow your house down, said the wolf.  
But he did not.
I will get in, said the wolf.
The wolf went down, down, down. 
Then the wolf ran down the road!
