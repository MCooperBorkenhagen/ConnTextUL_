The Three Billy Goats Gruff.
Long ago, there were three goats named Big, Middle, and Small.Like all goats, they loved grass, and they were always hungry for more.One day, Small said, "Look over there, across the river!"The goats looked.They saw a big, green hill."That hill is so green!" said Middle."It must be covered with tasty grass.""that grass will make a fine lunch," said Big."Let's go there now!"The goats reached the edge of the river.They saw a sign.It said: Warning! Troll Bridge! Do Not Cross!"I don't like trolls!" said Small.	"Neither do I!" said Middle."Don't worry," said Big.He pointed under the bridge."Look! We are three smart goats, and I see only one little troll.We can get across that bridge."Small went first.As he trotted across the bridge, his small feet made a small sound.Trip trap. Trip trap. Trip trap.The troll woke up."Who is crossing my bridge?" he yelled."It's only me!" said Small."I want some fresh grass to eat.Please let me go across.""No one may cross!" cried the troll."If you try, I will gobble you up!"The little goat stopped to think."Please don't do that," said Small."I am very small and thin. Wait for my sister. She is bigger.You will find her much more tasty.""Well," said the troll."All right then.Now run away before I change my mind!"So Small ran across the bridge.Next came Middle.As she trotted across the bridge, her middle sized feet made a middle sized sound.TRIP trap. TRIP trap. TRIP trap."Who is crossing my bridge?" yelled the troll."It's only me!" said the goat."I want some fresh grass to eat.Please let me go across.""No one may cross!" cried the troll."If you try to cross my bridge, I will gobble you up.""Please don't do that," said Middle."Wait for my brother. He is very big, and he will make a much more tasty meal."Well," said the troll."All right then. Now run away before I change my mind!"So Middle ran across the bridge.Then came Big.As he trotted across the bridge, his very big feet made a very big sound.TRIP TRAP. TRIP TRAP. TRIP TRAP."Who is crossing my bridge?" yelled the troll."It's only me!" said the goat."I want some fresh grass to eat. Please let me go across."The troll climbed up the bridge.He saw Big.This goat was very big, just as Middle had said."If you try to cross my bridge, I will gobble you up!" cried the troll."I am very hungry, and you will make a very nice lunch.""No, I won't," said Big."I am bigger than you, and I'm going to throw you into the river."With that, Big put his head down.Then he began to run.He ran right into the troll and pushed him off the bridge.The troll fell into the river.Then, Big crossed the bridge. He joined Middle and Small on the hill.They all felt very smart, and they had a lovely lunch of fresh, green grass.
