All About the Sonoran Desert.
The Sonoran Desert is very hot and very dry.For most of the year, it does not get any rain.Yet many plants and animals live in this desert.This tall plant is a cactus.The cactus can live here because it stores water in a special way.When it rains, the cactus roots soak up water.The plant swells up and gets bigger.The cactus uses the water until it rains again. 
This small plant is a cactus, too.When the cactus is little, it grows in the shade of a taller plant.A plant that helps a cactus grow is called a nurse plant!The cactus has very long spines.The spines help shade the plant from the hot sun.This desert plant has no leaves. 
The plant dropped its leaves to save water.Here is the same kind of plant after the rain.Now the plant is covered with new green leaves.Many animals make their homes in the Sonoran Desert.The animals find ways to stay cool on very hot days.Some animals find places to hide when the sun is very hot.The desert tortoise may dig deep into the dirt to stay cool. 
The tortoise also finds shade under large rocks.These desert animals have a different way to stay cool. 
They have long ears that let out the heat.Desert birds have other ways to cool off.This bird lifts up its feathers to stay cool.Some birds make nests inside a cactus plant.They stay inside the cactus during the heat of the day.They come out at night to hunt for food.The Sonoran Desert doesn't get much rain.But when rain does fall, desert plants burst into bloom.Then the desert is full of color!
