All About Dolphins.This is a dolphin.Dolphins live in the sea, but they are not fish.Dolphins need to breath air.A dolphin breathes through a blowhole on top of its head.A dolphin has one flipper on each side.It has one fin on its back and one fin on its tail.The tail fin helps the dolphin swim fast.Some dolphins can swim up to 25 miles an hour.Dolphins swim together in groups.The groups are called pods.A pod has baby dolphins and grown-up dolphins.A baby dolphin is called a calf.A calf stays with its mother for two or three years.Dolphins eat many kinds of fish, but they do not need to drink.They get water from the fish they eat.This pod is hunting for food to eat.Dolphins are noisy animals.They slap their tail fins on top of the water.They click, squeak, and even whistle.Dolphins make sounds to find food.Mother dolphins make sounds to call their babies.Dolphins love to play.They chase each other and ride on waves.They jump high out of the water just for fun.Dolphins are very smart and can learn to do tricks.This dolphin learned how to shake hands.When the dolphin does a trick, it gets a fish.Good job, dolphin!
