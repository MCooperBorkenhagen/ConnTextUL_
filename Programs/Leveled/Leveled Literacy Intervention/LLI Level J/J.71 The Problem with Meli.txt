The Problem With Meli.
Here comes Meli. 
Meli is Ron's dog.Meli is a happy little dog. 
Her tail is always wagging. 
She's a good dog, too, most of the time.But sometimes Meli doesn't do what Ron tells her to do.It's 6 o'clock and Ron is cooking dinner. 
He hears Meli barking and barking.Shhh, Meli. 
Be quiet, Ron says.But Meli barks and barks and barks.Why are you barking? Ron asks. 
He looks out the window. 
He can't see any dogs outside. 
He looks out the door but no one is there.Meli barks again.Do you have to go outside? Ron asks. 
He opens the door. 
But Meli just sits and looks up at him.She does not need to go out.Then she barks again and again.Ron can not get her to stop barking.The next night, Meli barks again.Meli, please stop that barking! Ron says.But Meli just runs around in circles and barks louder.Meli barks every night at dinnertime. 

She is very loud!It hurts Ron's ears. 
Ron doesn't know what to do. 
So he calls Karen.Karen is a dog trainer. 
She knows all about dogs.She tells Ron, I think Meli is bored.  
Dogs need a lot of exercise. 
Try this. 
Take her for a long walk at  o'clock every day. 
Take her out before she starts barking.

Dog trainers teach dogs how to be good pets. 
And they teach dog owners how to get their dogs to do what they want them to do.

That day, Ron takes Meli for a long walk. 
When they get home, Meli lies down on her red blanket. 
She doesn't bark that night.The next day, Ron plays with Meli for a long time in the afternoon.Later, Meli doesn't bark at all.Karen was right!After that, Ron gives Meli more exercise.Meli doesn't bark at dinnertime again, until...

One night, Ron is in the kitchen.
"Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!"
It's Meli.
"Oh, no!" says Ron. 
"Not again!"

But this time, Meli is barking at the TV. 
"Oh!" says Ron. 
"It's a dog show! 
Good girl, Meli! 
Let's watch the dogs together."
