Into the Sea.My name is Emma Hickerson. 
I am a scientist.I study plants and animals of  the sea.I use this little sub. 
It  is  a special sub that can  dive deep into the  water.The  sub has tanks of air for me to breathe.The sub has bright lights, too.They help me see the plants and animals.
I want to see what kinds of sharks live here.This sub has a camera.
So I take pictures of the sharks that swim by.
Sometimes I dive off a boat  into the  sea. 
I put on a special suit for diving.I wear an air tank.I wear a mask and flippers, too.I carry a special camera that works underwater.I take pictures of the seaweed.I want to see how big it  can grow.
I also take pictures of  a sea turtle.I want to see what kind  of food the turtle eats.
Then  I  go back to my lab. 
I look  at all the  pictures that I  took  in the sea.I use my computer.I write about the shark, the seaweed, and the turtle.
I love my job.I love to study the plants and animals of the sea.I'm writing a book about them!
