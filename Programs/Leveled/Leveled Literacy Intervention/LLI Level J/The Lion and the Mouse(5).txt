The Lion and the Mouse.One day, a Lion was taking a nap.Soon, a little Mouse came running by.He was in a hurry to get home.The Mouse did not see the Lion.So he ran right over the Lion's nose!The Lion woke up with a loud roar.He grabbed the little Mouse with his big paw."I'M GOING TO EAT YOU!" roared the Lion."YOU WOKE ME UP!"The Lion opened his big jaws.He was going to eat the little Mouse!"Dear Lion, please do not eat me!" said the Mouse."I did not mean to wake you up.Please let me go!"The Little Mouse kept talking and begging."Dear Lion, please, please let me go!If you do, maybe one day I will help you."The Lion laughed at the little Mouse.He laughed so hard that he could not stop."You think you can help me?" he asked."How could a little Mouse ever help me?""What a funny little Mouse you are!" said the Lion."I think I will let you go.I am not that hungry, anyway."The little Mouse was so happy!He ran off to his home."Thank you, dear Lion!" he called.But the Lion did not hear him.He was still laughing too hard!A few days later, the Lion was out walking.Suddenly, a hunter's net trapped him.He was caught.The Lion roared and tried to get free.But he was trapped!The little Mouse was close by.He was taking a nap.The Mouse woke up when he heard the Lion roar."The Lion needs my help," he said.So he went to find the Lion.The little Mouse saw the Lion in the hunter's net."I will help you, dear Lion," he said."Do not be silly, little Mouse," said the Lion."What can you do?No one can help me now!""I can help you," said the little Mouse.So the Mouse went to work.He bit at the ropes with his little teeth.He bit and he chewed.He chewed and he bit.Then he bit and he chewed some more.It took the little Mouse a long time.But at last, the Lion was free!"How can I thank you?" asked the Lion."What can I do for you?""Well, there is one thing," said the Mouse."I want to be your friend."And so it was.The Lion and the Mouse became best friends.And the Lion learned this lesson:"A little friend can be the best friend of all!"
