The Hare and the Tortoise.
A long time ago, there lived a Hare and a Tortoise.  
The Tortoise was quiet and kind, but the Hare was loud and liked to brag a lot.I'm the fastest animal of all! He would say. 
No one could ever beat me in a race.Hare bragged so much that no one believed him.You talk so much, said the Frog, that you don't have time to race.I'm pretty fast myself, said the Squirrel.Me, too, said the Raccoon.You're not as fast as I am, said the Hare. 
I'll race you.No thanks, said the Frog.Not today, said the Squirrel.I don't think so, said the Raccoon.But quietly, the Tortoise said, I will race you.You must be joking! Said the Hare.You are the slowest animal of all.I'm not joking, said the Tortoise.So the two agreed to race the next morning.Animals from near and far heard about the race. 
By the next morning, a crowd had gathered.Everyone was sure the Hare would win.After all, he was the fastest animal.But everyone hoped the Tortoise would win. 
After all, he was the kindest animal.Soon the Hare and the Tortoise were at the Start line.The Frog rang the bell and the race began. 
The Hare took off like a rocket! 
He ran past the Tortoise and called, Goodbye, Tortoise! 
This will be a very easy race for me!Then Tortoise walked slowly along the path.  
I will not listen to the Hare, he thought. 
Let him say what he wants. 
I will just keep going.
