All About Bats.
The sun goes down.Night comes to the forest.In houses around the woods, people get ready for bed.But not bats!They are just waking up.During the day, bats stay safe in roosts.Roosts are places where bats sleep.Bats sleep when the sun is out.They hide in caves or trees.They rest in barns and attics.Bats hang upside down to sleep.Bates wake up when night falls.They are awake when people are asleep.Bats are busy at night.At night, large groups of bats fly off.They search for food.Bats are mammals.Their bodies are covered with fur.Some bats look like mice with wings.Other bats look like foxes or little bears.Every night, bats eat half their weight in food.Some bats eat frogs, fish, or other bats.Some bats eat fruit.Most bats eat insects.Bats must hunt for food in the dark.Bats cannot see in the dark.How do they find tiny bugs?Bats use their ears to find bugs.Bats make high sounds as they fly through the dark.Bats make sounds when they fly.A bat sends out sound waves.The sound waves bounce back like an echo.The bat knows something is there.Bats use these echoes to find insects.The bat sends out a short, high sound.The sound wave hits an insect and bounces back to the bat.The bat knows how far to fly to cat it.Bats also use echoes to find their way through the black night.Bats use sounds such as clicks and chirps.Each bat makes its own special sound.Each bat follows its own echoes.Echoes keep the bat from flying into things.Bats fly and send out sounds all through the night.They fly and eat, fly and eat.Bat sounds are too high for people to hear.Bats flutter through the night as people sleep in their homes.The sun rises in the sky.It's the start of a new day for people in their homes.For bats, it's time to return to their roots, until night comes again.
