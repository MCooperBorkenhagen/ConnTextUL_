Hide and Seek.
Come now, Moosling, said Hoot.Play Hide and Seek with us.Moosling didn't know how to play. 
Beaver told him the rules.You hide, and I will look for you, Beaver said. 
The last one I find is the winner.I am going to win! Said Moosling. 
Moosling's friends smiled. 
Moosling was very big, and he had not played this game before. 
He couldn't win!Beaver shut his eyes. 
He began to count.The others went to hide.One, two, three.Mouse jumped into a hole.Ouch! Mouse jumped back out.Sorry, said Pins. 
But I was here first.Mouse looked for another place to hide.Turtle saw some nice, round rocks by the river.That gave him an idea.Moosling ran here and there. 
He didn't know where to hide.Could he hide behind a rock? 
Or behind a tree? 
Or in the pond?Could he hide in the tall grass? 
Or behind the hill? 
He sat down to think.Moosling began to get sleepy. 
He always got sleepy when he had to think too much. 
He didn't see the snow begin to pile up. 
He didn't hear Beaver shout. 
Here I come!Bear saw Hoot in a pine tree. 
She was easy to find. 
She always forgot to close her big, round eyes.Then Beaver looked for Pins. 
He found her.Ouch! He cried.Sorry, said Pins.Beaver looked at the rocks by the river. 
One of those rocks was Turtle's shell! 
Turtle must be hiding inside.Come out, Turtle! Shouted Beaver.But Mouse jumped out!There was room for both of us, said Turtle.That was a good hiding place, Beaver said to Mouse.Did I win? Mouse asked.  
Am I the last one you found?No! said Beaver. 
I didn't find Moosling!Beaver looked for Moosling. 
He looked here and there and up and down.Hoot and Pins and Turtle looked. 
Little Mouse wanted to look, too. 
But the snow was very deep.They could not find that moose!Where are you?I give up! Said Beaver.Then Pins said, The snow is snoring.What? Said Turtle.Pins said, This snow is snoring. 
Can't you hear it? 
She was right. 
The animals began to dig in the snow.Wake up, Moosling! Said Pins.Why? Said Moosling.Beaver said, You are the last one I found. 
You won!Yes! I knew I'd win! Said Moosling.And he went back to sleep.
