A Trip to the Firehouse.
 The fire chief himself greets the children at the door. 
"Welcome to our firehouse, girls and boys," he says. 
"We have lots of exciting things to show you." 
He lets everyone try on a real fire helmet.

Next they meet the firehouse dog. The children guess his name. 
They guess right it's Spot! 
The firefighters tell them that Spot has not eaten his breakfast yet. 
Would they like to come inside and feed him?

While Spot is eating, the children look around. 
David sees the firefighters' gear on one wall. Three firefighters show how long it takes for them to put it all on. 
Less than thirty seconds!

Katelyn finds the firehouse pole. 
"Hello, down there!" calls a firefighter way up at the top. 
He grabs the pole with his hands and legs, and slides down whoosh! 
The pole is an important part of the firehouse, he explains. 
It helps the firefighters move fast when the alarm rings. 
It is much faster than going down steps. 
When there's a fire, every second counts! 

Next the children are taken to see the dispatch room. 
Things are never slow here! 
It is busy all day and all night. 
Computer monitors flash. 
Telephone switchboards ring. 
It is here that phone calls come in, telling operators where the fires are. 
Some calls come from, the number many communities use for emergencies.

It is here also that alarms come in. 
An operator shows the children how the system works. 
Someone spots a fire and pulls a lever on an alarm box. 
That makes this bell clang right here in the firehouse! 
The bell clangs a certain number of times, in a pattern or code. 
The code is punched out on this tape, so it can be seen and recorded. 
The operators look up the code on this big blackboard to find out which alarm box the alarm is coming from. 
Then they know exactly where to send the fire trucks.
