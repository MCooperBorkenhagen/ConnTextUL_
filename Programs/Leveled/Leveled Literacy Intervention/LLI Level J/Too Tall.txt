Too Tall.Lola wanted to play on a team.On Monday, she went to try out for the volleyball team."Sorry!" the coach said."You're up there, and the net is down here.You're just too tall!"Lola was sad."They didn't pick me," she told her mother and father."But I still want to play on a team."Lola decided to try out for another team.On Tuesday, Lola went to try out for the softball team."Sorry!" said the coach."No one can pitch the ball to you.You're just too tall!"Lola hung her head."They didn't pick me for the softball team," she told her mother."Try again, Lola," said her mother."You'll find a team that's right for you."On Wednesday, Lola went to try out for the track team."It wouldn't be fair," said the coach."You'd win every race with those long legs!You're just too tall."Lola went home."I'm just too tall," she cried."No one will ever want me on their team!""Try again, Lola," said her father."Don't give up."On Thursday, Lola went to try out for the swim team.The coach shook his head."I'm sorry," he said."The pool is only four feet deep.You're much too tall."Lola didn't like to swim anyway, so she wasn't quite so sad.But she still wanted to be on a team.On Friday, Lola went to try out for the bowling team.Well, she tried to try out.But she couldn't even fit through the door of the bowling alley."You're just too tall," the coach shouted from inside."Sorry!"Lola was sad.When she got home, she said, "I give up. I can't be on a team. I'm just too tall."On Saturday, Lola's friends came over."Come try out for our team," said Jill."We need one more player," said Mindy."We need YOU!""NO!" said Lola."I don't want to try out for the team.The coach won't pick me.I'm just too tall."Lola's friends came back on Sunday."Please change your mind," they said."Please come and try out!We know you'll get picked for our team!"Lola thought about it.She still didn't want to try out for another team.But she did want to help her friends."Okay," she said."Let's go."So Lola tried out for the basketball team.This time, the coach picked her right away."I'm not too tall?" she asked."Not at all," said the coach."For this team, you're just perfect!"
