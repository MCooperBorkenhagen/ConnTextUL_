Nell can help.A sad whale is in mud and sand.  
It can not go back in the water.Nell can run.  
She can run and tell.Lots of men huff and puff.  
They huff and puff in the hot sun.  
Can Nell huff and puff?Nell can huff and puff.  
The men and Nell can do it.The whale is not in mud and sand.  
The whale is back in the water.
