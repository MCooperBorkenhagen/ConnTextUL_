Special times with others.Times we spend with others are the best.
  We meet at homes.We smile and hug.
  We eat and talk. 
 These are fine times for all.Every June the four of us have fun at the shore.
  Mom and dad and kids can swim. 
 We rest and swim and then rest and swim more.We hope it does not storm. 
 If it storms, we must get off the shore.Baseball games are fun times. 
 This sport has three bases and a home plate. 
 Men bat a ball and run.We clap and yell if they score a run. 
 We eat popcorn and hot dogs.Time with mom or dad is nice. 
 We sit on a porch or on a deck.
We take a walk or a ride. 
 We tell things that we are thinking.
