Gems.See all these stones. 
These stones came from inside Earth. 
All these stones are called gems. 
Gems are not all the same color.
 Gems can be red.
 Gems can be white.
 Gems can be pink.
 Look at these gems.
 Name the colors.
 Gems can be small. 
Gems can be big. 

But there are not huge gems.
 Look at these.
 Pick one you like. 
Stones can have bumps, gashes, and odd shapes.
 These stones will be cut. 
Then someone will make them shine.
 It takes lots of skill for this to be done.In this place anyone can hunt for gems.
Just dig them up. 
You do not need to dig deep.
 They can be on top. 
This kid wishes he had a gem.
 Some are not.
 Good luck!
