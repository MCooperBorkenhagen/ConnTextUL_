The surprise party.It is hot. 
 This path is dusty and bumpy. 
 But the sky is sunny. 
 Trot fast, trusty, trot fast, said Sir Prize. 
 I must try to see Queen Wendy.They rode and rode on that dusty and bumpy path.But Sir Prize needed sleep. 
He made a camp by a big lake.
 The sky had lots and lots of stars.
 When the sun came up, Sir Prize woke up and left his camp.He rode and rode.
 Then he saw some men walking and talking.
 When is their party in that big hall? One man asked.
 It is at five, the other man said. 
We can not be late.The party must be for Queen Wendy. 
It must be a surprise.
 We, too, can not be late.
 Trot fast, Trusty, trot fast, said Sir Prize.
 I must stop and get a gift. 
My, my! How fine this is! 
I will get this green pin. Queen Wendy will like this fine, green pin, said Sir Prize.This is the big hall, Sir Prize said. 
He peeked in. 
Then Queen Wendy and the others yelled, Surprise, Sir Prize!
 And that did surprise Sir Prize! 
The party was for him!
