Tales to tell.We all have a grand party every June.  
We talk and look at funny pictures.  
We tell tales. Grams starts. 
We had chores on the farm. 
 We picked corn. 
 We fed hens.  
One time I fell off my big horse and broke my left arm.Fishing is fun, said dad. 
 One time I got four fish. 
 Then I fell in and got all wet.
  My hat, pole, and all my fish went far down the creek.Baseball is for me, Mandy said. 
 One time I hit five home runs.  
They went outside the park.
 Everyone does tell lots of tales.
