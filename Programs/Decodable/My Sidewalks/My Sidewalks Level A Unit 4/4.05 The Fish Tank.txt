The Fish Tank.Jenny thinks, I will fix up our small fish tank. 
She sets up the fish tank.
 Jenny drops small stones in the tank.
 Clink, clank, clink, clank.Fish need water. 
Jenny fills the tank with water.
 Glub, blub, glub, blub. 
Jenny can pick any fish she likes.
 Jenny sees one guppy she likes. 
Then she sees five others she likes.
 She gets all six fish.Fish need to eat. 
Jenny gets fish flakes.
 Fish like to swim by plants.
 Jenny sees plants and a small chest.
 Jenny brings these things home.Jenny drops the chest in the water. 
She sees it sink. 
Will plants sink?
They do not sink. 
Jenny keeps them in place with stones.Jenny drops in six fish. 
Plink, plunk, plink, plunk, plink, plunk. 
Swim, fish, swim. 
Jenny thinks, our fish are the best! 
These six fish got a new tank.
 And they got a new friend - me!
