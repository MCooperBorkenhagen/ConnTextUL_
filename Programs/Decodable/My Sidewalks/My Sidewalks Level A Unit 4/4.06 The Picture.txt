The Picture.Frank made a picture. 
He hung it up. 
His friend Mandy came to see it.
 This is my new picture, he said.
 I think it is a wing, Mandy said.
 It seems like a big wing.Then Denny came to see it. 
This is my picture, Frank said.
I think it is a swing, Denny said. 
It is like our pink swing at home.Then Sky came to see it. 
This is my picture, Frank said.
It looks like five skunks on a tree trunk, Sky said. 
Yes! 
It must be five skunks on a tree trunk!Thank you all, said Frank. 
Mandy sees a big wing.
 Denny sees a pink swing.
 Sky sees five skunks on a tree trunk.
 I did not put any of those things in my picture. 
But if you see them, that is fine with me!
