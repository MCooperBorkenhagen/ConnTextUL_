Yard sale.We had lots to do for the yard sale. 
 Running a yard sale is hard.
  But it is fun.  
First we planned the date for the sale. 
 Then we made an ad.  Next my family picked things to sell. 
 Mom had about fifty things. 
 Tim gave shirts.  
Sis gave her purse. 
 I gave my stuffed fur dog.Then we made price tags for things. 
 How much for this purse? 
 What is the price for an old fur dog? 
 We spent lots of time tagging things.We needed to tell everyone where to go. 
 We had fun with this job.We had black and green and red to do the job.
  It was messy.  
But together we did a good job.We put things on benches. 
 Then it was about time for the sale to start.At nine, moms and dads and kids started to drive up.
 Cars parked at the curb. 
 Our time for sitting had passed.  More came. 
 They shopped and shopped. 
 Mom was the clerk. 
 I helped.  
I sat with the cash box.Once I asked a man, did you get a treasure? 
 He grinned and hugged his bag of stuff.  Running a yard sale is hard. 
 But my family had fun together. 
 We will plan a yard sale again next fall.
