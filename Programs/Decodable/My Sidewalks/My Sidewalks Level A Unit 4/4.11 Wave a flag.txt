Wave a flag.The U.S.A has a big party every summer. 
 On this date we think of our land and how it is a good place for us. 
 Stores close. 
 Moms and dads do not go to their jobs.
  More of us can have fun.See the U.S. flags.  
See red and white lines. 
 See white stars on blue.The white stars stand for our 50 states. 
 The lines stand for the 13 parts that made up this land when it was just starting.Bands march in the U.S.A. 
Bands have horns, flutes and drums. 
 Off they march. 
 Kids march in bands too.We can see pictures in parks and yards.
  Moms and dads bring snacks. 
 Kids bring games. 
 We all have fun.It gets dark.  
The sky has sparks that shine.
  Does the sky fill with color? 
 Are there big pops and bangs?Pop! Bang! Pop! Bang! 
Kids yell for more.  
Kids wave flags.
