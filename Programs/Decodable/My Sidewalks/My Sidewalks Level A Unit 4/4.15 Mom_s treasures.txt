Mom’s treasures.When I was ten, I had a bird, said mom.  
This is her cage. 
 It is very old.  
I can still see my bird sitting on this perch, singing tunes.This is my jump rope, said mom.  
It is not that old.  
All my pals skipped rope together on my side walk. 
 I can still see us jumping and grinning.My uncle once had a tan horse, said mom.  
This went on her back. 
 It is not that old.  
We trotted on a path about ten miles.This is very old, said mom. 
 It is a churn. 
It turns thick milk into butter.
  My family has kept it all this time.
  Next week, we will go shopping for milk.
 Then we will use the churn and make butter together. 
 Old things can be new again.
