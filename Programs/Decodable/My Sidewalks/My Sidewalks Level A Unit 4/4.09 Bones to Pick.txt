Bones to Pick.Deen rushes inside. 
He takes something from his backpack.
 Dad, do you know what this is? 
Dad grabs his glasses. 
I think it is a fossil. 
I think it is an old bone.
 Dad wants to see if the bone matches bones on the Web page.Are we done yet? Asks Deen.
 Yes, Deen. 
This bone is not a match.
 We will try again. 
I know someone we can ask. 
Dad and Deen went into a big lab.
 Big boxes and small boxes were filled with bones.Deen passes the bone he has to a man. 
Can you tell me what this is? Asks Deen.
 Let me see.
 The man smiles. 
It is five inches long. 
It is like this leg bone!
 It is from a small one like this.
 This is a fine fossil! 
Deen feels lucky. 
He smiles.
