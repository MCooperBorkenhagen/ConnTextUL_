Ants must work.Drill!  Drill!  Drill!  Drill!  
Nat was drilling spots in an ant nest.  
I am sick of drilling, said Nat.  
But ants must work, said Nan.But not at drilling! Said Nat.  
Come look at ant jobs, said Nan.  
Nat put his drill in its red box.  
Nat and Nan ran up ten big steps.Ants get big plant bits, said Nan.  
I can not lift big bits, said Nat.  
Big ants help ant kids, said Nan.  
I can not stand bad kids, said Nat.Nat ran fast.  
Where are you going? Asked Nan.  
Back to drilling! Said Nat.  
Ants must work.
