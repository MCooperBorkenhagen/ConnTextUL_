But will it fit? Snap! 
It is a snug fit.Tad and Pam can spell. 
They can print well. 
See the wig on the pig.Clint, Meg, and Dan are in a lab. 
They spot a red crab. 
A red crab can dig in the sand. 
Dan will print a fact on the pad. One, two, three, step, step, step. 
Gus and Nell twist and spin. 
Twist and spin! 
Twist and spin! 
They will not miss a step.
