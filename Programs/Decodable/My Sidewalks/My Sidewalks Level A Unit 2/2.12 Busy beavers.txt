Busy beavers.Cut! Cut! Cut! Crack! Drop! Smack!  
It was a snap, said dad.Jack will cut big sticks, said mom.  
Mack will pick up sticks and twigs.Drag sticks and twigs to the pond.  
Sticks and twigs are for the dam.Slap! Slap! Slap! 
What is it?  
It is Fox!  
It is fox, said dad.  
Quick! Quick! 
Swim fast.Fox went back to his den.  
What luck! Said Dad.Pack mud on the sticks and twigs.The dam is as snug as a rug.  
Mom and dad can rest on the dam.  
Jack and Mack can sit and snack.
