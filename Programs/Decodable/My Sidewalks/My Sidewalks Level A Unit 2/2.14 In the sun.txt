In the sun.Sad Rex is hot, hot, hot!  
What can block the sun for Rex?  
Grass is blocking the sun for Ant.  
Can Rex fit next to Ant?  
He can not.Bob is a green and yellow bird.  
Bob sits.  
A blue plant is blocking the sun.  
Can Rex fit next to Bob?  

He can not.Bess is a big, tan dog.  
Bess naps.Big green twigs are blocking the sun.  
Can Rex fit next to Bess?  
He can not.Plants help Ant, Bob, and Bess.  
Can plants help me?  Rex asks.  
Rex spots a big, big, plant.  
At last! 
It blocks the sun for Rex.
