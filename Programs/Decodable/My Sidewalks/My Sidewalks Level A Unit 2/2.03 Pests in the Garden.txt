Pests in the Garden.Look at the birds in the garden. 
Birds can not help us here. 
Mom, Dad, and Gus get rid of birds.Mom got a big red dress. 
Dad got a tan belt. 
Mom and Gus can stuff it. 
Dad can bend it up.Gus got a big hat to add. 
My big, big hat can sit on top.Mom and Dad grin at Gus. 
We can set it here, Gus. 
Flap, flap, flap. 
The big birds left the garden.
