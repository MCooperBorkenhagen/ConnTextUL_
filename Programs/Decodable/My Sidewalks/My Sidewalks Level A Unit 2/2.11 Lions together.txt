Lions together.Mom, dad, and cub are in a pride.Mom and dad can rest on grass.  
Cub can jump and jab and run.  
Cub can nap.The pride can help cub.  
Mom can lick cub.  
Cub will look for mom to get milk.Quick! Quick!  
Run fast and hunt. 
 What luck will they have?The hunt was the best.It fed mom, dad, and cub.
