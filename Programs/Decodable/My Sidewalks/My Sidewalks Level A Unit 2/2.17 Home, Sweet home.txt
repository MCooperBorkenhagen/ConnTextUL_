Home, sweet home.Black ants can dig big nests.  
Ant nests can look like hills.  
Black ants dig spots in nest.  
Ants put eggs in spots.Black ants come and go from nests. 
 They put bug and plant bits in spots.  
Ants do not like a mess in the nest.  
They get rid of a big mess fast.Where can black ants rest?  
Black ants dig rest spots in nests.  
Black ants work well together.
