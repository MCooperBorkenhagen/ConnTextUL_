What Am I?Out on a tree branch sits Fuzz.Fuzz seems just like a cute worm.But she keeps asking, What am I?This is Tad.Tad swims in Green Pond.Tad swims just like a good fish.But he keeps asking, What am I?Fuzz sees Tad in Green Pond.Am I a worm? Fuzz asks.Yes! yells Tad. Am I a fish?Yes! Yells Fuzz.Then Fuzz hides in an odd shell.She can’t see Tad.Tad can’t spot the worm he saw.Next, Tad feels big changes.He has legs!He has feet!He can walk!Then Fuzz gets free from her shell.I am a butterfly! she yells and smiles.And Tad hops from pad to pad.I am a frog! he yells and smiles.
