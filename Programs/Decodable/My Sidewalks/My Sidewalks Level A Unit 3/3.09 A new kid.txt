A new kid.
There is a new kid who will come to this class.  
Sam is the new kid.
What is Sam like?  
When will he get here?  
That is what we kept asking.
Chuck kept asking, can Sam catch?  
Can Sam pitch?
Rich kept asking, can Sam ride a bike fast?  
Can he ice skate?
Mike kept asking, can Sam run fast?  
Can Sam chase and catch us in tag?
Then the new kid came to class.  
But Sam was not a he. 
Sam is in your class, said miss Chen.
Sam can bat, pitch, ride a bike, skate, run fast, and catch you in tag.
Sam is grand! Said Chuck and Rich and Mike.  
Come pitch and hit with us.
