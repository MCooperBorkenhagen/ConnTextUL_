Bugs.Stop and look at gardens.You’ll spot bugs, lots and lots of them.Bugs buzz past your nose!Bugs walk on plants and stones.But you can’t spot all bugs.Small bugs can hide very well.And bugs can look like stems and sticks.Bad bugs don’t help gardens.Bad bugs eat stems and buds and vines.Bad bugs could eat too much!Bad bugs can kill plants.But bugs can help gardens too.They’ll eat bad plants and bad bugs.Bugs can help plants get big.All gardens can use bugs that help!
