We all grow.Look at the little duck.It was in a shell.The little duck is not big yet. 
 But its mom and dad are big now.Little duck will get just as big.Look at the little fish. 
 Where are its fins?It will get fins.  
It will get big. 
 Big fish use fins to swim.Look at Trish.  
Trish is still little. 
 Trish can not stand up yet.But Trish will get big. 
 Trish will get big like her mom.
