Winter  Changes.Will this rabbit look the same all the time?Last winter this rabbit was white.That helped it hide.Now it is not white.Can it still hide?Lakes freeze in winter.Ducks go to a hot place.But ducks come back when winter has passed.This animal will take a big nap.It will sleep all winter.It is hidden deep down in this cave.What will happen if we wake it up?This small animal can’t get nuts in winter.It must work and save nuts now.This way it can still munch on nuts all winter.
