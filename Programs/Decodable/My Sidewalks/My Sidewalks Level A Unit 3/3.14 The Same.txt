The Same.Can we see snakes change?This snake has shed its old skin.It gets fresh skin.But it is still the same snake.Can we see this crab change?Crabs need good shells.They can use shells left out on the sand.This crab seems like the same crab we just saw.It is.This is the same crab with a good shell!This bug changes a lot.It is small.Then it gets big.See it in the tree?It is big and green.Snakes, crabs, and bugs can change.But they are still the same.
