Worms Help Plants.Yikes, Kid!Do not step on this white stone!You could step on me. 
It’ll make plants very sad!Yes, I’m just a small worm!But worms help make nice dirt.Plants like that.And plants like us.Dirt is the place I call home.I do not like it when that home is wet.If it is wet, I rest on stones and rocks.If dirt isn’t wet, I slide back in it.Plant bits fall in dirt.I will munch and munch on them.And I will eat bits of bugs!While I munch, I dig small holes in the dirt.I dig lots and lots of small holes.Those small holes make nice dirt!And all those holes help plants.You can see that plants like me.Worms can make nice dirt.That helps plants get big and tall.Now, Kid, help save this worm!Step on that stone and not on this one!
