When Seasons Change.Hot, hot weeks are here!Yellow sun shines down.Tall trees are dressed in green.Bees seem to buzz with life and fun.Hot weeks have passed.Trees are dressed in red and yellow.Plants and bugs feel a big chill on the way.Winter hides sleeping plants and grass. Ice bends tall trees.Ponds freeze and kids skate.This chill will not last.The ice has melted now.Hot sun is back at work.
