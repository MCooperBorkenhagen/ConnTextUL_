How does a garden change?The pond froze.This garden was just a big patch of ice.Plants could not poke up in the ice, not yet.Then ice gets thin and melts.Wet drops fall and fall on the garden.Grass gets very green and tall.Buds pop up on stems of garden plants.Next the sun is hot.Gardens fill with red and yellow roses.Can your nose smell these roses? Mine can.Bugs buzz and eat bits of plants.Then winds chill gardens.Winds nip your nose.Plants get set to rest.Ice will be back.
