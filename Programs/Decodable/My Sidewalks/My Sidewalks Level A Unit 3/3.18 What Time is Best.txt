What Time is Best?What time is best?Is it summer?Is it fall?Is it winter?Is it spring?Let me see.Last summer, we ran in the sand.We dashed with kites. Zip!We hid.Hide and seek!Peek!I like summer.Last fall, Dennis passed me the ball.I passed it back in a flash.We had on thick plastic helmets.We crashed.Crack!We ran fast and had fun.I like fall.Last winter, Ellen and I rode sleds.We walked up big hills.Thump!Thump!That felt like work!We yelled and dashed down those big hills. I like winter.Last spring, Dad and Mom walked with me way up on Blossom Hill.We had a lunch basket.Keep out, ants.We had a nice picnic.I like spring.What time is best?Is it summer?Is it fall?Is it winter?Is it spring?I can’t tell. I like them all.
