Chester Greenwood: inventor.Chester put on his hat and scarf.  
He got his ice skates and went to the pond.
 This scarf makes my ears itch, he said. 
 I can't skate when my ears itch.Chester took off his scarf and went home. 
 What could he find to fix his problem?At home, Chester got wire and bent it. 
 He added fur at the ends. 
 Then Chester put that wire and fur on his ears. 
 His ears felt warm.Chester went back to the pond.  
He put on his skates and went to the edge. 
 These muffs kept his ears warm.Chester went faster and faster on the ice.  
These wire and fur muffs kept his ears warm for a long time.Where did you get those? Pals asked.
  I made them, said Chester.  
These are muffs for my ears.Chester made muffs for all his pals. 
 Then he added a bigger band and thicker fur.
 People far away asked for these muffs.  
We all still use them!Did those kids back then think that Chester was smart? 
 Yes, they did. 
 What do you think? 
 Did Chester think smart? 
 You can be the judge!
