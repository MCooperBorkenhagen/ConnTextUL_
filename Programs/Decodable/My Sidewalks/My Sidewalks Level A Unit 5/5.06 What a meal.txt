What a meal!A man with a pack on his back walked up to Miss Gail and spoke. 
I have walked a long way and need rest. 
 May I stay and eat here?Keep walking, Miss Gail snapped as she hung a pot with water on the fire.  
Miss Gail was grumpy and mean. 
 We don't have much and it won't feed us all.But I have all that we need, said the man. 
 He got a stone from his pack and held it up. 
 Most people can't make meals from stone, he said. 
 But I can.A meal from this small stone? Asked Miss Gail. 
 Let's see that! 
 The man dropped the stone in the big pot and stirred it.Do we have turnips? The man asked. 
 This stone and turnips will make a nice meal. 
 Miss Gail added turnips to the pot.Last time, I had a nice meal with meat in this pot, the man said.  
We have meat!  Ray called. 
 He got it. 
 Then he dropped it in the pot.A meal with grain is nice, said Lee. 
 We can get rice, called Dean. 
 Then Miss Gail took a sip.  Yum! She said.  
All we needed was the stone.Can we write how to make this? Asked Ray.  
May we keep the stone? 
 I must keep it, said the man.  
I may need it for my next meal.
