The bus pass.Madge and her mom sat at the bus stop. 
 Madge held on to her bus pass.  
Wind swirled. 
 Madge grabbed her hat. 
 Her bus pass drifted away.Her pass landed in back of a hedge. 
 Madge stuck her hand far into that hedge.
  But she didn't get her pass.Madge picked up a long stick at the edge of the grass. 
 She stuck it into the hedge.  
But it did not get close.  
I will find a longer stick, she said.Madge got a longer stick and stuck it in the hedge. 
 She got close, but she still didn't pick up her pass.I need gum, Madge said.  
Gum? Mom asked. 
Yes, mom, Madge nodded. 
 I think gum will help.The gum was sticky. 
 Madge took it and put it on the stick. 
 She stuck the stick into the hedge.Her buss pass stuck to the gum. 
 I got my pass, yelled Madge. 
 Mom grinned and said, Madge, that was smart!Just then the bus stopped. 
 I saw that! Said the man on the bus. 
 You are the smartest girl I've seen. 
Thanks! Said Madge with the biggest grin ever.
