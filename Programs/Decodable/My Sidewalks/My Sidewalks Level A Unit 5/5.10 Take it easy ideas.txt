Take it easy ideas.We have small pages with stories.  
We need one big page.  
We can set two pages side by side.  
Soon we will have one big page of stories.How will these pages stay together? 
 Can we clip them? 
 Yes!  
But clips my not stay. 
 Wait!  
Can we use tape? 
 Yes!
 Tape helps with this job.Lots of kids love grape drink. 
 But grape drink is hard to take in the car.
 It spills and stains the seats. 
 Moms and dads don't like spills.Wait! 
Can we use drink boxes? 
 Yes! 
 It is much better to sip grape drink from a box. 
 Then moms and dads will be happier.It is hard to get all this stuff up these steps. 

 It is too much for one trip. 
 It falls and scatters behind you.Wait! 
Let's place these supplies in a backpack. 
 Pull the backpack up on your back.  
Yes!
  That is much better!
