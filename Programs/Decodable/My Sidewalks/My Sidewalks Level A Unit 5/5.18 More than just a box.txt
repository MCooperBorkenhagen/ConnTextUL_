More than just a box.At school Miss Naple saved boxes. 
She had little boxes and big boxes. 
 Let's use these boxes in clever new ways, said Miss Naple.Josh began by using tops of boxes for framing his pictures. 
 First, he taped pictures on the backs of the frames.
  Then he added tiny stars.Ned made a secret place for his critters to live.
  He painted a box. 
Next, he set his critters inside. 
 Then he placed his box on the table.Jill put stones in her box.  
She closed the box and taped the lid.

  She taped on wheels. 
Next, she tied strings to the boxes. 
 My train goes fast, joked Patty.Josh, Patty, Jill and Ned smiled because they were smart.

 It was easy.  
You can try it too.
