Rosa Parks.Rosa Parks worked hard all day. 
 Then she went and waited for a bus to take her home.
  A bus stopped. 
 Rosa got on and sat down.
 After more stops, the bus was filled. 
 In 1955 some buses had rules.Black people and white people could not sit together.
  And if a bus was filled, black people had to let white people sit first.A white man got on Rosa's bus.
  The man that drove this bus said Rosa must let the man sit in her seat.
  I won't leave this seat, she said.Rosa Parks did a brave thing. 
 She just sat still. 
 She stayed in her seat.
  She broke the rule. 
 For this, Rosa Parks was sent to jail.People got mad and yelled, don't ride buses. 
 These are bad rules. 
 For more than a year, most black people did not ride buses. 
 They walked or rode in cars.Rosa Parks helped people see that the bus rule was bad. 
 It was time to write a rule that treated all people on the buses the same.Rosa Parks spoke up and helped us see things in new ways. 
 Today black people and white people ride together. 
 We can thank Rosa Parks for that.
