A Ramp for Stripes.Brad went with his mom and dad to get a puppy.  
Brad spied three puppies. 
 One was black, one was spotted, and one had stripes.Brad, I don't think you need to pick a puppy, said mom.  
Look at that puppy walking behind you.  That puppy picked you.At home, Brad played with the puppy and petted it all day long. 
 Stroke, stroke, stroke.  
Soon the puppy slept in Brad's lap.Let's call him Stripes, Brad said.  
Brad picked up Stripes and set him on the window seat. 
 Stripes wagged his tail and went back to sleep.Each day, Brad and Stripes played and played.  
When Stripes got sleepy, he sat down by the window and wagged his tail.Look, mom and dad! Called Brad.  
Stripes loves that window seat. 
 He would like to nap in the sun, dad added.Stripes stayed at the window and wagged his tail. 
 Stripes can't pull himself up on the seat, cried Brad.  
He's too small.What can we do? Asked dad.  
Let's make a ramp, called Brad.  
That's a fine plan.  
Stripes will be happier if he can get up, said mom.Dad, mom and Brad all worked together to make the ramp. 
 Soon they had the perfect ramp for Stripes. 
 Step up, Stripes, Brad called.Stripes stepped on the ramp and hurried to the top.  
He peaked out the window and wagged his tail.  
Then Stripes curled up to nap in the sun.
