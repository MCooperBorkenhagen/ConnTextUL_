Popple popcorn.This is Pete Popple. 
 He makes popcorn and sells it.
  Kids like his popcorn. 
 Moms and dads like his popcorn. 
 Here's how it all started.Last spring, Pete went to a ball game.
  Before he went, he made popcorn. 
 Pete did not want dull popcorn. 
 He added lots of spices.Mom said, this sure tastes yummy. 
 It tastes a little like apple pie.
  Pete filled a big bag with popcorn. 
 Then Pete left for the game. 
At the game, Pete gave popcorn to his buddies. 
 Yum! Yum!  They said.  
We like this kind of popcorn.The next day Pete made more. 
 It's sweet, said Calvin. 
 It's very light, said Ty. 
 It tastes like apple pie, said Gail.How did you make it? Asked Ty's mom. 
 It's simple, said Pete. 
 I popped popcorn and added spices.That day people ate lots of popcorn. 
 Before long, none was left. 
 You should sell this popcorn, said his buddies.
  And that's what Pete did. 
 He made lots of popcorn. 
 At each game, people yelled, Popple popcorn is best. 
 Keep popping, Pete.
