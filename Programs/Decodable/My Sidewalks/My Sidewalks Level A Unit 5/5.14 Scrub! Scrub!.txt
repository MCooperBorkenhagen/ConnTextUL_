Scrub! Scrub!In the past, people washed things in streams.
  Some still do.  
It is hard work to make sure things get clean.Dip! Scrub! Dip! Scrub! 
 This kind of washing is hard to do.
  Then people hung things outside to dry.Later people washed things at home. 
 They made bubbles with soap. 
 They scrubbed in the sink. 
 None of this was simple.Dip! Scrub! Dip! Scrub! Dip! Scrub! 
 People hung things on outside lines. 
 It look lots of time to wash and dry like this.Fill the tub.  
Add soap.  
Drop shirts in.
 Plop! Plop! Plop!
 Jiggle wiggle! Jiggle wiggle!
Squeeze shirts.Drip! Drip!
 This way takes a little less time. 
 Shirts get clean and bright. 
 But people still dried shirts outside.Now people can use these to wash and dry things. 
Plop! Plop! Plop! 
Just drop shirts and pants in.
  Add soap. 
 That's it!Then put things in here to dry.
  Tumble! Tumble! 
 It dries things fast.
 This way is not hard at all.
  Before long, all is clean.
