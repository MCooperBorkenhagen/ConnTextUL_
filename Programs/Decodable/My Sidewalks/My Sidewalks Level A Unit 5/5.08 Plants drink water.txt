Plants drink water.Plants need water to grow big and tall.  
Can plants drink water?  
Yes!  
And you can show it.
  Just get white mums, vases, red drops, and water.First, put some water in the vases. 
 Next, put ten red drops in each vase. 
 The water should turn red. 
 If it is not dark, add ten more drops.Next, let a grownup cut the bottom off each stem. 
 Then put one white mum in each vase.Leave the mums in the vases.
  Let them soak for more than a day.
  Then check them over to see what happens.First, the stems turn red. 
 Up and up, dark red water pushes up the stems. 
 Then each plant's blossoms turn red.Water flows up the stems and to the blossoms. 
 Did you know this would happen?  
This is the way plants drink water and grow.
