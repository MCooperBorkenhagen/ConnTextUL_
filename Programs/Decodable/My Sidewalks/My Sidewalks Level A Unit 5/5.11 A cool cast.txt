A cool cast.Krysta Morlan hadn't walked well from the time she was a small girl. 
 Then her doctor treated her leg. 
He put on a cast to help her leg heal.On hot days, Krysta's skin itched inside her hard cast. 
 Krysta wished she could scratch it. 
 She wanted to pull off her cast, but she could not.Soon Krysta came up with a way to feel better. 
 She tried this.  
She stuck a tube in her cast and pumped air into it.
  The air flowed on her leg. At last Krysta felt better!  
The air made the itch stop. 
 Krysta kept the pump strapped snug on her leg. 
 This gadget made Krysta much happier.Now Krysta did not need to scratch, scratch, scratch! 
 She wanted to share her gadget. 
 She showed it at a contest.People cried, who is behind this?  
It was Krysta. 
 Her gadget was the best in this contest.  
This teen had made a gadget people could love.Krysta planned more things that help.
 She made a bike that floats on water. 
 Splish splash!  
Kids who did not walk well had fun with this bike.What will Krysta think of next?  
We will just have to wait and see.
