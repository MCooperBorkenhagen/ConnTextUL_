Then and now ideas.Before we had cars and planes, we rode horse. 
 We rode in buggies. 
 It was not fast.Now we can go faster in cars.
  Now we can fly in planes. 
 A plane flies high in the sky.
  Planes fly very fast.We can send letters to tell things. 
 But it might take days to get letters. 
 Now we can send e-mail. 
 It's fast.  
You can be sure this is quick.We can use phones to tell things too. 
 First we had phones at home. 
 Then we had pay phones for calls outside. 
 Now we have cell phones.At first people played games like this. 
 None of these games had lights. 
 None made beeps and buzzes.But now we can play a new kind of game. 
 These games have bright lights! 
 They bing and buzz. 
 These games zap and flash.
