Ice cream cones.Ice cream is yummy.
 We can eat ice cream in cups.
  We can eat it in dishes. 
 And we can eat it in cones.
  Cones? 
 How did we get cones?In 1904, lots of people visited a big fair. 
 Kids went because school had ended.  
Everyone had fun and ate yummy treats.It was a hot summer. 
 Frozen treats were just what everyone needed.  
A man was selling ice cream.  
He served it in dishes.  
Soon this man used up all his dishes. 
But he still had lots of ice cream left.This ice cream man was working near a man making waffles.  
The waffle man was clever. 
 He curled a waffle into a cone shape.He and the ice cream man put ice cream inside this waffle cone.
  At that moment, the ice cream cone was invented.Ice cream cones were a big hit. 
 No one needed cups or dishes!  
People had to lick fast because ice cream melts and drips.When an ice cream truck goes by where you live, think of that clever waffle man at the fair. 
 He used waffles in a crazy but super way.
