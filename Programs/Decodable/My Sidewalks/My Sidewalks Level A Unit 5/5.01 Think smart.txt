Think smart.A cat is up in a tall tree! 
 Kids want that cat down. 
 What can kids do?  
Kids can think smart.Kids can get a long stick and ribbon. 
 Then they can shake the stick and ribbon. 
 Cats like to chase ribbon. 
That cat will get down.This girl has a big mess in her desk. 
 She puts things away.  
The mess gets taller and taller.
 Things get harder to find.  
What can she do?She can place her things in a small box.
  Yes!  
That's all it took. 
 Kids can think smart.One kid can lift a big box. 
 Two kids can lift a bigger box. 
 But they can't lift the biggest box.
  What can these kids do?They can ask for help.
  A bunch of kids together can lift the biggest box.
  That's it!
 Kids can think smart.
