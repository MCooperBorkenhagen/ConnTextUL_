 He did not find a seed inside.There is one big seed in coach's peach. 
 There is one big seed in Willow's plum. 
 There should be a seed in my strawberry! Sloan said.Would you look again? Asked coach. 
 I think you'll see seeds. 
I can't see seeds in Sloan's strawberry, said Willow.That's it, called Sloan.  
What? Asked Willow.  
Sloan grinned. 
 Seeds are not inside my strawberry. 
 They are outside.We spotted all the seeds, coach! Called Willow. 
 Coach had a smile.  
Lunch was fun that day!
