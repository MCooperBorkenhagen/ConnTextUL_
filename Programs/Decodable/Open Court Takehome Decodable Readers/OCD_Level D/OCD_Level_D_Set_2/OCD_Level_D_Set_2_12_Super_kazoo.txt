Super Kazoo.

At the Zoo.
My name is Drew, and this is the tale of my
Super Kazoo.

This is my big brother Stew. He is really cool.

Sometimes when my mom and dad are too
busy, Stew picks me up after school.

Last Tuesday we went to the zoo.

We saw raccoons and baboons running on roofs
and splashing in pools.
There were shops that sold all kinds of things like
candy and gifts and bright balloons.

We walked and we talked, and soon we were
so hot, we had to cool off.
So we sat on a stoop and ate two scoops of ice
cream with two huge spoons.

Out of nowhere, there came a band ...
led by a flute,
then a bassoon
and then, of all things, a kazoo!
The band huffed and puffed some
strange kind of tune.

The sound of that kazoo was so strange and
so new, I knew that I had to have one, too.

My Super Kazoo.
There were so many colors, I just couldn't
choose!
Red? Green? Blue?
I had no clue! I was way too confused.


So I closed my eyes tight. I reached in
with each hand,
first left ...
then right ...
and I pulled out a Super Kazoo.
It was not just red or green or blue,
but red AND green AND blue!

I quickly picked it up and blew. Out flew a 
sound, not like a duck or a loon, but much more
like a moo.

I stopped and I waited for everyone to hiss
and boo. But they just danced to the kooky
sound of my Super Kazoo. Even my big brother
Stew got into the groove.

On the way home, I blew and I blew. I played
such a cool tune that everyone from here to the
moon came to dance and salute the sounds of my
Super Kazoo.
