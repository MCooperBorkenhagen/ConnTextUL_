Zigzag Step Out.

Zigzag Has a Plan.
From sunup to sundown, Zigzag sat in the
yard. If a cat passed, it was his job to run to
the hedge and bark. Ann did not like cats in
the yard. They could mess up her plants.

It was not bad in the yard. It was not fun for
Zigzag if he could not run.
But what was this? Did Ann get another dog?
Wait. She had two dogs. Two large dogs!

The dogs were put in the yard. They said
not one word.

"Arf!" said Zigzag. "Arf, arf!" But the two dogs
still said not one word. They did not budge
from the edge of the yard.

"What is this?" said Zigzag as he went to sniff
one of the dogs. It did not smell like a dog.
"These are not dogs," said Zigzag. "These are
just rocks."

Zigzag said to himself, "Cats are not smart. Cats
will look at the rocks and think they are dogs. They
will not get into the yard. They will just run off.
With these dogs to sit in the yard, I can look for fun.

Out of the Yard.
After lunch, Zigzag had his chance. He left the
yard. He did not look back.

Zigzag went to the park. He ran with the dogs
there. He was fast. They could not catch him.

When Zigzag got back to his yard, there was a cat
in a curl next to one of the rocks! "What is this?" he
asked himself. "The rocks did not trick the cat."

Just then, Ann was in the yard. Did Ann
spot the cat? Did Ann spot him? Zigzag felt
bad that he had left his job.

But Ann did not get mad. She only said, "Zigzag, a cat!"

Ann let Zigzag back into the yard.
"Zigzag, bark!" she said.
And Zigzag did bark. The cat ran.

"Well, Zigzag," Ann said, "these dogs will not make
the cats run. You are still the only one that can do
the job. Will you still help?"
"Arf!" said Zigzag. "Arf, arf!"
