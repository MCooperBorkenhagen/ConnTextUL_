Summer Pen Pals.

It's Fun Here.
Dear Tammy,
It's fun here at our camp
in the forest.
There is so much more to
do here than there is at home.
Yesterday, I waded in the
lake.
It's rocky, but I like it.
Jan.

Dear Jan,
I know what you mean.
There is always something fun to do.
Here at the beach we go swimming
each day.
We have races to see who is the fastest
swimmer.
I am the fastest swimmer in my family.
Tammy.

Hi, Tammy!
Last night we hiked in the dark.
The moon looked so big.
A bat flapped near us.
Tim yelled, but I did not!
Jan.

Hi, Jan!
We all like to go fishing on 
the dock.
Dad always catches the 
littlest fish.
I catch the biggest!
Tammy.

Tammy,
The kids here are really 
nice.
We play games and go for
hikes.
They all go camping a lot, so
they teach me cool things.
Jan.

Jan,
The kids here are nice, too.
We make things the sand and
tell stories.
They are the funniest!
Tammy.

It's Not So Much Fun Here.
Dear Tammy,
Mom and I rowed on the
lake.
It was really windy, and it
got cooler and cooler.
I still haven't warmed up.
Brrr!
Jan.

Dear Jan,
It's not like that here.
Today is the hottest day since we
got here.
I got burned, and it really hurts!
Now I have to stay inside until I
am better.
Tammy.

Hi, Tammy.
Hiking is no fun when it's
raining.
The path was muddy, and it
got muddier.
I got soaked and dirty.
It still hasn't stopped raining.
Jan.

Hi, Jan.
We went fishing on a big boat
today.
Mom and Dad both got sick, but I
got even sicker.
I don't think I like boats very
much.
Tammy.

Dear Tammy,
Can you believe it is still rainy
here?
I am tired of everything being
wetter than wet.
I can't wait to go home.
Jan.


Dear Jan,
Each day here is warmer than
the last.
I am tired of everything being 
hotter than hot.
I hope we go home soon, too.
Tammy.

"Yeah! Jan is going home, too!"
"Hooray! I will see Tammy soon!"

"It's good to be home. I like it much better
than camping."
"It's much better than the beach, too."
