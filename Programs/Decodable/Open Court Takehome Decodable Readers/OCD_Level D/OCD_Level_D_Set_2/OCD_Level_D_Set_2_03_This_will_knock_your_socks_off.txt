This Will Knock Your Socks Off.

Dad is Back.
The clock went tick, tick, tick.
The clock said two till six.
Dad is back! Dad is back!

Dad has a gift for Mom.
Dad has a gift for Tom.
Dad has a gift for ...

"Don't I get a gift?" I asked Dad.
I was sad. I was mad.

"Do not be sad," said Dad. "Do not be mad.
I did not forget. How could I forget?"

"Your gift is big. Your gift is the best. Forget
the rest. This gift will knock your socks off!"
"It will not knock my socks off," I said.

"It will," said Dad. "It is out in the grass. You
cannot look yet."
I had to ask, "How big is it? Is it as big as an ox?"

"Will it fit in a box?"

"Is it one of the flock? Will it make a big mess?"

"Can I pet it a lot? Can I sit on its back?"

The Gift.
Dad said, "It is not in a flock. It will not make a mess.
We all can pet it a lot. We cannot sit on its back."

When at last I could look, I ran to the grass.
Dad said, "Isn't the gift big? Isn't the gift the best?
Doesn't it knock your socks off?"

It was big.
It was the best.
It didn't knock my socks off ...

I wasn't wearing any socks!
