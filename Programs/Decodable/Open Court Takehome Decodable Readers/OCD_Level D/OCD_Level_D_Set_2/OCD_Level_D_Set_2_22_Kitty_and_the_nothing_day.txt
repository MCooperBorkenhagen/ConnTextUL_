Kitty and the Nothing Day.

Mom Wants to Know.
Eery day after school, Kitty O'Connor came in the
door and slammed it too hard. She threw down her
backpack at the foot of the stairs and stamped into
the kitchen. She was always starving after school.

Kitty's mom was always there, holding out a
glass of milk and a plate of cookies and asking,
"So, what did you do in school today?"

"Nothing" was all Kitty ever said. But that
didn't stop Mrs. O'Connor from asking.

"That's terrible," said Mrs. O'Connor. "The trees,
dogs, and all the people must have disappeared."
Kitty grinned. "Yes, it was one big, empty
space."
Kitty's mom laughed. "Now tell me about 
school."

Kitty Tells All.
"Well, to begin with, there was no school there."
"Nothing at all?" asked Mrs. O'Connor.
"No classrooms, no walls. I just stood there."

"And did nothing," added Mrs. O'Connor.
"Right. That is, until recess."
"Recess. More cookies, Kitty?" asked Mrs.
O'Connor. Kitty took two.

"At recess," Kitty went on, "no one was in the
play yard. So I thought, "Good, now I can have the
best swing all to myself!"
"That seems like fun!"
"But the swings were gone! No slide, no seesaw,
no monkey bars -- nothing!"
"Dear me!" gasped Mrs. O'Connor.

"Then it was lunchtime. I picked up my tray and
looked down at my plate. 'What is this called?' I asked
the lunchroom lady."
"What did she say?"
"She said it was the Nothing Special. I didn't eat it."

"So that's why you're so hungry!" said Mrs. 
O'Connor. "And what about the rest of the day?"
"We had a spelling test. But there were no 
words on it. I got a zero."

Mrs. O'Connor clucked.
"Now may I go upstairs? I need to call Jane."
"But, Kitty," said Mrs. O'Connor, "what about
Show-and-Tell?"
"Right," Kitty said. "We had Show-and-Tell. I
brought in nothing. Now may I go?"

Mrs. O'Connor's eyes opened wide. "Why, that's
remarkable!" she gasped. "What did the kids say when
they saw it? Did you carry it in your backpack?"
"Mom!" cried Kitty, her hands over her ears. She 
backed out of the kitchen, laughing. Mrs. O'Connor
was laughing, too.

"And then in soccer practice, your team lost zero
to zero because there was no ball!" Mrs. O'Connor
went on.
"Okay, Okay," said Kitty.
"And you read nothing because there were no
books! And in music class, when everyone tried to
sing, nothing came out! And ...."
"Okay! Okay!" Kitty cried. "It was NOTHING
DAY!" Kitty jumped up the steps to her room.

The next day Kitty stormed into the house as
usual. But this time she closed the door as gently
as a breeze.
Kitty smiled. "Mom, I had the best day."
