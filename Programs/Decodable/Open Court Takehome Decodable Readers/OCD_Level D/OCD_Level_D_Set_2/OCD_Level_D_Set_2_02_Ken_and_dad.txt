Ken and Dad.

Set Me on Track.
"Help me, Dad! I cannot make a backpack.
It looks like a hill on a back. Can you make a
backpack? Can you set me on track?"

"In a bit, Ken. I have this big stack to do.
I am up to my neck! When I do this stack,
I'll make a backpack."

"Help me, Dad! I cannot make a cat.
This cat looks sick. Can you make a cat?
Can you set me on track?"

"In a bit, Ken. I have this stack to do. I am up to
my neck! When I do this stack, I'll make a cat."

"Help me, Dad! I cannot make a hen in a pen.
It looks like this hen is in bed. Can you make a
hen in a pen? Can you set me on track?"

"In a bit, Ken. I have this stack to do. I 
am up to my neck! When I do this stack, I'll
make a hen in a pen."

"Dad! Help me! I cannot make a hat on this
man. It looks like a cat has landed on him.
Can you make a hat? Can you set me on track?"

"In a bit, Ken. I have this big stack to do.
I am up to my neck! When I do this stack,
I'll make a hat for your man."

Can I Help?
"I can help, Ken. Can I make a backpack?"

"No, Dad. You cannot make a backpack."
"Can I make a cat? A hen in a pen? A hat
on a man?"

"No, Dad. No cat. No hen in a pen.
No hat on a man."

"Hmmm ... No cat? No hen in a pen?
No hat on a man? What's up, Ken?"

"I did it MYSELF!"
