Up to Bat.

Gone.
I had a bat. Then it was gone.
"Too bad," said Pam. "I bet it's
under your bed."

My bat was not under my bed.

I had a cap. Then it was gone.
"Too bad," said Pam. "I bet it's in the den."

My cap was not in the den.

I had tan shoes. Then they were gone.
"Too bad," said Pam. "Ask Dad."

Dad did not have my tan shoes.

I had two best pals, Ben and Tam. They were gone, too.
"Too bad," said Pam. "I bet they went to play."

That did it! I was sad. I was mad. I was sad and mad.
"Tell me where my stuff is!" I said to Pam.
Pam ran.

Map.
"I can help you get your bat, cap, and shoes
back. And Ben and Tam," said Pam.
She gave me a map.

On the map were Dad, ten hens in a pen, and a
man in a hat.
"What is this?" I asked Pam. I was still mad.
"It's a map," said Pam. "It can help you get your
bat, cap, and shoes back. And Ben and Tam."

So I ran fast past Dad.  I ran fast past the 
ten hens in a pen. I ran fast past the man in
the hat -- and ...

... there was my bat! There was my cap!
There were my shoes! And Ben and Tam!

And there were Len and Nan and Sal and Mat!
Pam was there, too.
"Still mad?" she asked.

I was not sad.
I was not mad.
I was up to bat!
