Queen Kit.

Maybe This!
Queen Kit sat in her seat.
She sat with her chin on her hand.
Queen Kit did not smile.
It was hard to rule the land.

The queen was not mean.
The queen was just glum.
"What can we do to make Queen Kit smile?"
her subjects asked each other.

"Maybe a cute dress
that is easy to press
will please Queen Kit!"
said Ned, the dressmaker.

"Maybe a purring pet
that is nice and quiet
will please Queen Kit!"
said Pete, the pet seller.

"Maybe a flying kite 
that is shiny and bright
will please Queen Kit!"
said Tom, the toy maker.

"Maybe a tasty bite to eat
that is not too sweet
will please Queen Kit!"
said Conrad, the cook.

"We will surprise the Queen!" said the men.
So they hid the cute dress, the purring pet, the
flying kite, and the tasty bite to eat.

Surprise!
"Surprise!" said Ned, the dressmaker.
"The cut of this cute dress will make you
feel better."

But Ned tripped on the dress and fell,
letting out a little yell.

"Surprise!" said Pete.
"This purring pet is perfect!"
But Pete dropped the pet.
And the pet ran away.
Pete was so upset.

"Surprise!" said Tom.
"This flying kite is just right, Queen Kit!"
But Tom let it go.
And the kite got away.
Tom didn't know what to say.

"Surprise!" said Conrad.
"This tasty bite
will be a treat to eat!"
But Conrad tripped
on his own two feet.

And the tasty bite spilled.
It spilled on Queen Kit
who looked surprised.
And what do you think
Queen Kit did?

Queen Kit smiled.
