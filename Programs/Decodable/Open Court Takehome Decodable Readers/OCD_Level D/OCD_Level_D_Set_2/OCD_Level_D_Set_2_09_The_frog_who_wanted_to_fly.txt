The Frog Who Wanted to Fly.

Ivan Can't.
Once there was a tiny frog named Ivan. Ivan was 
not a happy frog. He sighed all the time.
"Why are you sighing?" asked Mr. Pie.
"All my life I've wanted to fly," said Ivan with a sigh.

"Why?" asked Mr. Pie.
"Why not?" said Ivan.
"Frogs can't fly," said Mr. Pie.
"This frog will," Ivan said.
Ivan decided to ask that nice Jane Triangle for
help. She was a scientist. She'd tell him how to fly.

While on his way, Ivan heard his name.
"Hello-o-o-o-o! Ivan!" called Pam My-Oh-My.
"Can you help me shut this trunk? The top will
not shut tightly."
Ivan looked at the trunk. Then hw got on top
of it and jumped on it with all his might. The
trunk shut tightly. "It's fine," he said.
Pam My-Oh-My smiled. "You are very nice. Can
I get you mint ice cream?"

"No, thanks," said Ivan, "I'm off to see Jane Triangle.
She will tell me how to fly."
"But frogs can't ..."
"This frog will."

While on his way, Ivan met Sy Bly. "I need to cross 
the pond," said Sy Bly. "Can you get me to that side?"
"Hop on my back," offered Ivan.
Sy Bly hopped on.
"Now hang on tightly," said Ivan, and jumped into
the pond.

"Are you all right?" Ivan asked when
they had landed.
"I'm wet," Sy said. "But I'm fine.
Thanks for the ride!"

While on his way, Ivan met Dan DeeLight. "Oh,
no!" cried Dan DeeLight. "I'm sending cards to ten
friends, inviting them to my party. But the tenth
stamp is inside this desk. And -- just my luck! -- the
top is stuck. I can't get the stamp!"

In no time, Ivan had slipped his long tongue under
the top and picked up the stamp. "Here it is," smiled
Ivan, the tenth stamp stuck to his tongue.
"Delightful, delightful," exclaimed Dan DeeLight.

Ivan Can.
While on his way, Ivan ran right into Jane
Triangle herself!
"I was just on my way to see you," said Ivan.
"Well, here I am," said Jane Triangle.
"I want to fly," said Ivan. "You are a scientist.
Can you help me?"

"Why do you want to fly?" asked Jane Triangle.
"Who knows?" Ivan said. "But I think about it all the
time. It's something I want. A lot," he added.
"Everyone needs something they want a lot," said
Jane Triangle. "I wanted to be a scientist all my life. But
.... Ivan, might you be setting your sights too high? You
are a frog, and frogs can't fly. Frogs do frog things."
"Like?" asked Ivan.

"You can jump," said Pam My-Oh-My. "You are
the best jumper I've seen."
"You can swim," said Sy Bly. "You are the best
swimmer I've seen."
"And you can grab trapped things with your
long tongue," said Dan DeeLight.
"I can't think of anyone who can do all that,"
said Jane Triangle.

Jane Triangle smiled at Ivan, but Ivan did not smile
back. "I can do frog things. Where's the fun in that?"
he asked.
"I understand," said Jane Triangle.
"I want to do something I can't do," he said.

Ivan went home. He thought and thought. Then
he brightened. He smiled. He danced a jig. He sang
a silly song. Then he called his friend at the lab.
"I've made up my mind. This is what I want," he
said.
Jane Triangle kept quiet while Ivan explained.
"But what if it's not right for me? I mean, I am a
frog," said Ivan.
"A frog who fights for what he wants!" added
Jane Triangle.

"Well, I sat there and I thought -- perhaps I 
can't fly, but maybe I can dive."
