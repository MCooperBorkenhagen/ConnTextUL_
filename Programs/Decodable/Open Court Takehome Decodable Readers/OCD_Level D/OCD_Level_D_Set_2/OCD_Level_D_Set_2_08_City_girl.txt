City Girl.

Letter for Eve.
One day, Eve received a letter.
"A letter for me?" said Eve. "Maybe it's about a party!"

Dear Eve,
We miss you.
Please come and
visit us on our farm.
Hugs and kisses,
Steve and Lee.

"But I can't leave the city, Mommy!" Eve complained.
"We have fun here!"
Eve's mom tried to make her feel better. "You'll have
fun on Steve and Lee's farm, too. You'll see, Sweetie."
But it seems her mom did not make Eve feel better at
all. Eve was not sure she wanted to visit the farm.

"I'll eat a piece of yummy candy. Then I'll feel
better," Eve whispered to herself.
But it seems the candy did not make Eve feel
better at all. She still was not sure she wanted to
visit the farm.

Steve and Lee met Eve at the train.
"We are very happy you are here!" beamed Steve.
"You are a city girl now. But you can be a farm
girl, too," added Lee.
"I'm happy being a city girl," said Eve. "I am not 
sure I want to be a farm girl!"

"This is our farm," said Steve.

"Let's feed these geese," said Steve.
Eve peeked at the geese. "I do not like geese,"
she whispered.

"Mom, it's muddy and dirty and dusty here! The
geese are mean! Please come and get me. Steve
and Lee can come to our home!"

"Eve, I can hear that you are tired. I'll pick
you up in a week, Sweetie."

A Letter from Eve.
"Here you are! The farm is busy in the day, and it's
busy after dark, too, Eve. Come on and see!"

"What is it?" asked Eve.
"Little bugs," said Lee. "Each bug has a little
beam that twinkles on and off."

"Shhh!" whispered Steve. "See the deer leap?"
"Deer do not leap in the city!" said Eve.

Lee tucked Eve into bed.
"From your bed, you can see the sleepy farm,"
said Steve.
"I'm sleepy, too -- like my kitten," Eve said.
"Sweet dreams, farm girl," Lee whispered.

Dear Mom,
Please do not 
pick me up in a 
week.
The city is pretty,
but I like the
farm, too.
Hugs and Kisses,
Eve.
This is my kitten,
Fuzzy.
