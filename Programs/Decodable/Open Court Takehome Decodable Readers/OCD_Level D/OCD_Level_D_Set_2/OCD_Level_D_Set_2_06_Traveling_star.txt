Traveling Star.

Shimmering Star.

Tom gazed at the stars. He was thinking of
something to write for class.

Flashing across the glittering sky was a big,
shimmering star! "Where will the shimmering
star go?" Tom whispered. "Where will it travel?"

Tom started to write his poem.
"Where will you go,
shimmering star,
glittering across the sky?"

Tom was thinking much too long.  His head
started to nod.

The glittering star and Tom had places to go.

There is no end to where the shimmering
star and Tom can go. In glittering Paris, Tom and
the traveling star danced and danced.

The shimmering star and Tom traveled to London. Big
Ben, the clock, rings its bells. Where shall the traveling
star and Tom go next? Will they go under the bridge?

Tom traveled far with the glittering, shimmering
star. He is standing on a large wall of blocks.

The glittering star can travel far. Imagine where
a traveling  star can go! With much thinking and
imagining, a shimmering star can travel far!

Traveling far.
Tom sat up with a start. He had slept much too
long! With all this thinking and imagining, at last
Tom had all the words for a glittering star poem.

Tom started to finish his poem.
"How far will you go,
traveling star,
flickering across the sky?"

Imagine! A glittering star. A shimmering star
traveling far! All this thinking and imagining!
Let a shimmering star surprise you!

Where will you go,
shimmering star,
glittering across the sky?
How far will you go,
traveling star,
flickering across the sky?
