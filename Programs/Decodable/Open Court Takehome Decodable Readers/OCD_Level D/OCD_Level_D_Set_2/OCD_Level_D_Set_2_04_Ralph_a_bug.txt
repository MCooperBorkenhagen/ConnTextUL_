Ralph, a Bug.

Bug in a Jar.
Ralph, a bug, sat upon a pinkish-red cattail.
It was a blissful day, and a robin sang a song.
Ralph was resting in the sun when ... 

Ralph was plucked from his spot. He
felt himself lifting up.
PLOP! Ralph landed in a thick, glass jar.

With a twist of a wrist, a lid was set on top of the jar.
"I am stuck in this jar," said Ralph. "Shucks! I didn't
think that he could catch me!"
Ralph sat thinking.
"I will get out. I must get out. I will hop up and fly."
Ralph hopped up and ... 

BANG! Ralph hit the top. Then ...
THUMP! Ralph hit the bottom.
But Ralph had to get out. Ralph hopped up and ...

CRASH! Ralph hit the top. Then ... 
WHAM! Ralph hit the bottom.
Ralph had a scratched chin and a nicked lip. He
had hit his chest and bumped his leg. He was a wreck.

"Six is my list. I'm finished," said Ralph, and gave up.
Ralph wrapped himself up in the grass to nap for a bit.

PLINK PLINK! Ralph's pal, Hatch, a wren,
pecked at the thick glass.
"Ralph, get up. It's such a blissful day.
Let's frolic in the sun!"

Ralph blinked at his pal who looked a bit odd.
"Can't," Ralph said. "I am stuck in this jar.
"Did you try to hop and fly?" asked Hatch.
"Yup," said Ralph.

"Try again," said Hatch.
"Not again," grumbled Ralph. "Six is my limit. I'd
hop up and hit the top with a BANG! Then THUMP,
I'd hit the bottom."

"It's such a blissful day," said Hatch. "You can't sit
in a glass jar. Try again."
"Not again," grumbled Ralph. "Six is my limit. I'd
just hop up and hit the top again. Then I'd hit the 
bottom. I am scratched and nicked. I am a wreck!"

"Are you chicken?" asked Hatch.
"I am not chicken," said Ralph, but "six is my limit."

"Cluck, cluck, cluck!" clucked Hatch.
"Stop! I am not a chicken!" yelled Ralph.
"I will try again, but just you wait. I'll end up
with more cuts and scratches. Stand back!"

Ralph hopped up and ...
WHISH! Ralph flew out the top of the jar.

"There," said Hatch, "if at first you don't
succeed, fly, fly again!"
