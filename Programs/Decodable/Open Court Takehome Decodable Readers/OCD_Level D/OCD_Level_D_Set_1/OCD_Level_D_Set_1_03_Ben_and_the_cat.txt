Ben and the Cat.

Ben went to the big pen. There was a little cat in back
of the big pen. The cat ran when Ben went to pet him.

When Bed fed him, the cat had a nap in Ben's lap.
"I'll let him eat food from a pan," Ben said.

When Ben went to tend to the pigs, the cat sat on
Ben's cap. "Scat, cat," Ben said. But the cat didn't scat.

When Ben went to get the hens, the cat ran after Ben's 
best hen. "Scat, cat," called Ben. But the cat didn't scat.

When Ben went to lock the pen, the cat ran after a rat,
and Ben fell. "Scat, cat," said Ben. But the cat didn't scat.

Ben sat on a box next to the cat.
Then the cat sat in Ben's lap. "Well," said Ben.
"I guess I have a new pet. I'll call you Scat."
