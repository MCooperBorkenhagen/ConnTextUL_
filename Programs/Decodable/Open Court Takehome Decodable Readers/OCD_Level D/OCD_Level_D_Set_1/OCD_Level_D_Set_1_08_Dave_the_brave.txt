Dave the Brave.

"I am the bravest!" Dave said. "Today, I swam across
a lake to save a dog."
"But, Dave," said his little sister, Val, "you can't swim."

"I came face-to-face with a big cat in Africa,"
said Dave.
"But, Dave," said Val, "you are scared of cats."

"I saved a snake from a dragon," said Dave.
"But, Dave," said Val, "you hate snakes."

"I raced a truck on a dirt trail," said Dave.
"But, Dave," said Val, "you can't race."

Just then a big snake came up to Dave and Val.
"I'm afraid of snakes!" said Dave.
"Scram, snake, scram!" yelled Val.
She chased the snake.

"You're brave, Val," said Dave.
"Yes, Dave," said Val, "But will I ever be
as brave as you?"
