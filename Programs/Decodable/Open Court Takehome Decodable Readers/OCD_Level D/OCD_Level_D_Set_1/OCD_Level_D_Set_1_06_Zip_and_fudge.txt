Zip and Fudge.

Zip and Fudge wanted something to do.
"Let's trick the other animals!" said Zip.

They hid until a turtle crept past. "Oh!" yelled Zip
and Fudge. The stunned turtle ducked under a rock.
"That was fun!" said Zip. "Let's do it again!"

Zip and Fudge scared a bird, a caterpillar, a frog, a
giraffe, and a rat. Then Zip said, "This is fun, but I want
to rest."
Zip and Fudge curled up in a circle. When they got
up, it was dark.
"We'd better run back to the stump," said Zip.

Just then, a large monster stepped in front of Zip
and Fudge.
"Did you trick the animals?" thundered the monster.
"Uh ... uh ...," stammered Zip and Fudge.

"You have upset the animals," said the large monster.
"Promise that you will not trick them again!"
"Yes, Yes," muttered Zip and Fudge.

Zip and Fudge rushed back to the stump. Their
fun ended. But the other animals had a long chuckle!
