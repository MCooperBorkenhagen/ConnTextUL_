Sleepy Steve.

Sleepy Steve was afraid. He hurried into a big
building and hid beneath a heap of sticks.
"I am free!" Steve eeked. "But I am very sleepy! I
need a place to sleep!"

Sleepy Steve peeked out from beneath the
sticks. "Eeek!" said Steve. He saw big sticks. He saw
little sticks. Steve was afraid.

Sleepy Steve began to sneak past the sticks. "Eeek!"
said Steve. He saw big feet. He saw little feet.
He leaned back and fell asleep where he was.

When Steve was awake, he came from beneath the
sticks. He peeked back at them.
"Please tell me what you are," Steve said to the sticks.
But the sticks did not speak.

Then Steve saw a sign near the sticks. "Dinosaurs?"
said Steve. "These sticks are a large dinosaur!"

Steve climbed up the dinosaur and made a neat nest.
"Pleased to meet you," whispered Steve. And the two
new pals settled into a deep peaceful sleep.
