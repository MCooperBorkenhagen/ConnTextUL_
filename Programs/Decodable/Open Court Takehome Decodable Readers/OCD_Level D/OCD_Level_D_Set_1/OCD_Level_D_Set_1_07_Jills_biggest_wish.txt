Jill's Biggest Wish.

Jill always played by the big river. She loved
to go fishing and swimming. Most of all, Jill loved
digging in the sand.

When other children visited, Jill said, "You must dig."
The other children were not interested.
One day Jill dug up a little bottle. She patted it
with a rag.

Then, a little girl was in front of Jill.
"Make a wish!" giggled the little girl.

"Are you kidding?" gasped Jill.
"Not a bit! Think of a wish!" insisted the little girl.
"Well," said Jill, "I wish for a million dollars."
"In a jiff!" answered the little girl. She tapped her lip
and stared at Jill. But nothing happened.

"Wish again," said the little girl. "But think of 
an important wish."
"Well," said Jill, "I wish for a pal who will go digging
with me."
The little girl tapped her chin. She skipped in
a circle, but nothing happened.

The little girl kicked the sand. "Granting wishes
just isn't what I want to do," she said. "But I do love
to dig!" she said with a wink.
Jill grinned at her new pal. The little girl had
granted her biggest and most important wish.
