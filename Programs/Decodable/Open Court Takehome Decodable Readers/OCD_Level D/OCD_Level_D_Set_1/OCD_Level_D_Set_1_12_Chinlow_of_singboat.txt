Chinlow of Singboat.

In the little village of Singboat lived a girl named
Chinlow. She loved nature. Nature loved her.
The birds of the forest sang more sweetly for her.
The doe of the forest ate from her hand. The snows on
the hill shone whitest for her.

The roses Chinlow planted would always grow tall.
"Where does Chinlow's talent come from?" people
of the village asked. "Even the rainbow is more
dazzling over Chinlow's home."

News of Chinlow's talent reached the emperor in
faraway Pancoat.
"Could the talent of a simple child overthrow the
emperor?" he wondered. "I must not let this go on."

The emperor called for his wisest teachers.
"I must know," he said, "the talent of Chinlow."
One by one the teachers spoke to Chinlow.
"Show me," each teacher said.

Chinlow looked into the face of a tiny rose. The rose
Chinlow looked at began to grow until it became the
loveliest rose in the garden.
Each teacher said, "I saw her talent, but I do not 
know it."

Finally, the emperor called Chinlow to him. "Show
me," he said. Chinlow looked into the face of a tiny
rose. The rose grew and became lovely. Then the
emperor said to Chinlow, "Now look at me."
Chinlow looked into the emperor's eyes. The
emperor saw love in her eyes. "Now I know her talent,"
he said, "and I am not afraid of it. Her talent is love."
