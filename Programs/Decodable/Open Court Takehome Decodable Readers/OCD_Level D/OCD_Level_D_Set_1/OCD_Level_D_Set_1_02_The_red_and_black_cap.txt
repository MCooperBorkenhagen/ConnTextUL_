The Red and Black Cap.

"Oh," said Mr. Kam, "a red and black ball cap!"
"Where?" asked Len.

"There!" said Mr. Kam.
"I see the red and black cap," said Len.
"Pat the cap," said Mr. Kam.

"The cap is damp. It will mat," said Mr. Kam.
"This cap is bad."

"Oh!" said Pat. "Can Dan have that ball cap back?"

"Let Dan have the cap," said Mr. Kam.

"Dan has his cap back!" said Len.
"Yes," said Pat. "This is Dan's damp, red
and black ball cap."
