Flower the Cow.

Once a brown cow named Flower lived on a farm
just outside of town.
Flower stayed mostly out in the field. She kept her
head down, and never seemed to notice the other
animals around the farm.

"How can that cow be so proud?" Howdy the
horse wondered aloud.
"Why, she can't even pull a plow!"

"Pull a plow?" shouted Stout the sow. "That's
nothing to be proud of! However, if she could root
around in the ground with her snout, now that
would be something to be proud of!"

"Root around?" clucked the hens and the other barnyard
fowl. "That's nothing to be proud of. However, if she
could lay eggs like ours, now that would be something 
to be proud of!"

Finally, little Scooter the mouse spoke up. "Well,
I don't know about plowing, or rooting, or laying
eggs," she said.
"But I do know that you can always count on
Flower for just the right amount of sweet milk."

Scooter looked around at the animals. They
looked down at the ground.
"It sounds," said the mouse, "like some animals
around here are too proud ... but I doubt that
Flower is one of them!"
