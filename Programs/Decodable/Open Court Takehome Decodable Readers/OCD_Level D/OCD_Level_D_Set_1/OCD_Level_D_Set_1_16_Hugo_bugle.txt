Toast.
"Spike, I have a new idea," said Hugo. "It is 
a faster way to have toast when you wake up."

"At night, tie a shiny pie plate to a wire. Make
the wire go to a window. Set a bag of marbles
by the window. By the bed, put a few stones."

"Place a tube on the side of the window. Below
the tube, glue the blue pail to the end of a pole.
Put the pole under the lower window."

"Tie a rope to this side of the window. Tie a
heavy ice cube tray to the rope. Use the heaviest
one you can find. Load the toaster. Go to bed."

"Wake up to noisy music. Scoop some of the 
heavier stones into the shiny pie plate. When the 
shiny plate drops, the window opens."

"When the top window opens, sliding
marbles go through the tube. The pail fills, and
the pole dives low. Then the lower window
pops wide open."

"The heavy ice cube tray hits the right spot.
And very soon, up pop the warmest slices of toast."

"Tell me the truth, Spike. Is this a cool idea?"
asked Hugo.
"Oh, my. The idea is nice," said Spike. "But I 
do not like toast."

A New Unit.
"Joan, you might like my new idea," said Hugo.
"I will try," said Joan with a shining smile.
"It is a unit that you use to speak to any human,
even miles away," said Hugo.

"The unit is a huge hat. It has wires, fuses,
and tubes. Use the blue tube to speak. To hear,
use the white tubes in the holes on the sides."

"Right on the top is a light in a red cone.
While the light glows, it shows that a special
microchip is in use. The microchip changes
speech into code."

"The code is made of blaring tones from
bugle, flute, and tuba music. A spy will not have
a clue to what you say. A spy will hear the
happiest tune, not a clue."

"No matter where you go on the globe,
you can easily use the unit. If you tie it on
your chin, you can use it when you ride a 
bike, row a boat, or fly in a plane."

"So, Joan, will you try it?" asked Hugo.
"No, thanks," said Joan. "I will simply use my phone."
