A Day in the Amazon.

It is a peaceful day in the Amazon. A light breeze
shakes the tree leaves.
High above the jungle, a huge eagle watches as the
rain forest wakes up. So far, the day seems still.

But the rain forest is never completely quiet. Deep
in the jungle, creatures stir. Spider monkeys leap from
tree to tree. Their tails grab long vines as they find
their way to ripe fruit.

A bird perches in a fig tree. It uses its bright
beak to snip off a fig. It throws the fig into the air.
It catches the fig in its beak.

Nearby, a giant anteater opens an ant nest. It
pokes its long nose into the nest to find its tiny food.

A jaguar slips silently through the trees below. The
jaguar's spotted coat hides it well. It stops beside a
stream and dips its tail into the water. A fish rises to
the bait. Surprise! The jaguar has a tasty meal.

In the trees above, only the three-toed sloth remains
quiet. It moves so slowly that mold grows on its fur.
The green mold helps it hide in the leaves.
The sloth isn't moving at all. The lazy sloth is asleep.
When night comes, it will slowly wake to eat.
