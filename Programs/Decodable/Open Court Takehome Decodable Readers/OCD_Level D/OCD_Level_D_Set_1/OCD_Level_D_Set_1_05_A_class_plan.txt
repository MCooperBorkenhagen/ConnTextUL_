Pets in Class.

A Class Plan.
"My dog has six pups," said Phil. "They are so much fun.
They run and tumble. Then they nap in their soft bed."
"Have you met Hip-Hop?" asked Ann. "Hip-hop is Todd's
pet frog."

"Lots of children have fun pets," said Bob.
"Ms. Kent, can we. bring pets to class?" asked Phil.

"You can," said Ms. Kent. "But we must
plan the things we will do."

"We can help with the plans. We can list the things
we must do. Then we can have pets in class," said Pat.
1. Pet day Monday!
2. Get pets after lunch.
3. Pets must have a tag.
4. Some pets can be 
in a box.

"Pets in class will be lots of fun," said Ann.
"I am glad we can make a plan for pets in
class!" said Todd.

The Pet Day.
"What did you do in school today?" asked Mom.
"Not much," sad Bob.

"But today you had pets in class.
Was it fun?" asked Mom. "What did you do?"
"Oh, some stuff," said Bob.

"Pat's cat hops the best," said Bob.
"You had cats hop and skip in class?" asked Mom.
"What else did the cats do?"
Get that cat!
Sam! Sam! You have pep!
Look at Sam hop and skip!

"Not much," said Bob.
My cat can hop, too.
Watch my cat skip.
This is fun!

"What next?" said Mom.
"I got to catch a pup," said Bob.
"You had to catch pups?" asked Mom.
Stop! Grab the 
dogs! Get the cats!

"Yes. Phil's pups were running and dumping things.
Then the dogs ran, too. The dogs ran, the cats were
hopping, and the pups hid," said Bob.
"That's too bad!" said Mom.
"It was fun!" said Bob.
Catch the pups! I got a pup!

"What else?" asked Mom.
Come back. Hip-Hop.
Look at Hip-Hop.
Look at Ms. Kent!

"Oh, not much. Todd got his frog back.
Frogs do not come back when you ask them to,"
said Bob.
Ribbet! This is wrong!

"The cats were skipping and hopping. The dogs
were rushing at cats. A bunch of pups ran and hid.
A frog got away. What a mess!" said Mom. "I bet there
will be no pets in class again!"
"That's what Ms. Kent said," said Bob.
