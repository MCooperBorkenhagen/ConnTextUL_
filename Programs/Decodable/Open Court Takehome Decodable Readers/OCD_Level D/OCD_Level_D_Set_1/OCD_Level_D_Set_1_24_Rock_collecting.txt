Rock Collecting.

Have you ever picked up a rock out of the soil just
because you liked the way it looked?
If you like looking at rocks, you might become a
rock collector. Rock collectors are people who are
curious about rocks.

Rocks are part of nature. You might find rocks
by rivers. You might find them on the beach. You
might even find them along a street in a town.

Different kinds of rocks have different features. Some
rocks, like limestone, are quite soft. These rocks easily
break into powder. Others, like quartzite, are hard.

Rocks with fossils are highly prized by serious
collectors. These rocks contain the remains or marks
from plants and animals that were alive long ago.  Fossils
turn up in the most surprising places. Keep your eyes
open. You might find one too!

Rocks are not just for studying. Small rocks can be
painted with smiling faces or made to look like tiny mice.
Two large rocks might make a nice set of bookends.
A giant rock might be just the right size for climbing.

So the next time you are walking, you might
just find the rock that will make you a rock
collector well into the future!
