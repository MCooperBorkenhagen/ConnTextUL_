Fran's Gift.

Once there was a queen with three girls.
Their names were Martha, Greta, and Fran.
"Tomorrow is my birthday," said the queen to the 
girls. "The girl who finds the smartest and most
useful gift will be the next queen."

Martha and Greta worried. "There is a grand party
tonight!" they said. "We must get a gift quickly or we
will miss the party!"
"The market is close," said Martha. "I will run there
and purchase Mother a sparkling cart."
"Martha is smart," thought Greta. "I will run to the
market, too. I will buy Mother a marble throne."

The youngest girl, Fran, puzzled over her mother's
gift. Finally, she said, "I will knit a scarf with stripes."
Fran bought yards of green and blue yarn and 
started to work.
Fran's sisters spoke shrilly to her. "Our gifts are
more charming," they said. "You will have to work
hard. You will miss the grand party!"

Fran knit and knit. By twilight, her arms hurt, but the
scarf still wasn't finished.
"I will work into the night," she said.
Martha and Greta sneered. "Think of missing a grand
party for a silly scarf."

The next day, the girls took their gifts to the queen.
"Here is a sparkling cart," said Martha. "See how
it shines!"
"This marble throne is the largest in the kingdom!"
said Greta.
"These gifts are very charming," said the queen, "but
I already have a cart and a throne."

Then Fran gave the queen her scarf.
"This scarf," said the queen, "will keep me warm,
and green and blue stripes are charming! You will be 
a smart queen, Fran."
And Fran was.
