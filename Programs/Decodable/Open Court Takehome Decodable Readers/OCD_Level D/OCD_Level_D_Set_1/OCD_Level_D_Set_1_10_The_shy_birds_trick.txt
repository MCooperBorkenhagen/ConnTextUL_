The Shy Bird's Trick.

Once a sly fox lived deep in the forest.
The sly fox was very hungry.
"I might die of hunger!" he cried.

Then, the sly fox spied a bird flying in the sky.
"I will trick this bird," said the sly fox. "It will make a
nice pie."
"Oh, shy little bird," called the sly fox. "You look
tired. Come and lie on my soft fur."
The bird in the sky didn't say anything.

"Sweet, shy bird," said the sly fox. "I need your help
to tie this string on my pie box. Inside is a yummy pie
for my mother."

"Is that a lie? " asked the shy bird.
"Oh, no," cried the sly fox as he licked his lips.
"I need your help."
"I'll bet there is no pie in that box," the shy bird
mumbled. "I'll bet that sly fox wants me to to be the pie."

"I will help you," replied the shy bird. "Hold the string
with your long tail while I tie it," she said to the fox.
Then, the shy bird tied the fox's tail to the box in a
tight knot.
"My tail is stuck!" grumbled the fox.

"See, fox," sighed the shy bird, "you are sly, but
not as sly as I."
"Bye-bye, sly fox!" cried the bird, and she flew off
into the sky.
