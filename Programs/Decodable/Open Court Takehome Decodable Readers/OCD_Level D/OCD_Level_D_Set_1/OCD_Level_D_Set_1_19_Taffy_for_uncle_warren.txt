Taffy for Uncle Warren.

Uncle Warren was an unhappy man. Every day, he
went to the end of the pier to fish. Uncle Warren
never got anything. He just sat lonely and unhappy.
Everyone thought he was just disagreeable.

Uncle Warren's niece, Marcella, was an unselfish girl.
She worried about him. Every day, she watched him on
the pier. One chilly, rainy morning Marcella made a
decision. She went to the end of the pier.
"Look what I have, Uncle Warren! Taffy! Your favorite
candy!" she called. Uncle Warren didn't say anything.

"Have some, Uncle. It tastes wonderful!" said
Marcella.  Before Uncle Warren could disagree, Marcella
popped a piece of the taffy into his mouth. Uncle
Warren silently chewed the taffy.
As her uncle ate, Marcella retold a funny story.

"Remember my first piece of taffy?" she asked. "I
had a useless tooth that wouldn't come out. You said
a good piece of taffy would get my tooth out. You
said a good piece of taffy could do anything."
The story made Uncle Warren grin. Marcella hadn't
seen him grin in a very long time.

Every day after that, Marcella returned to the pier to
give taffy to her uncle.
One day, during a really delightful story, Marcella
dropped a piece of taffy into the water. A fish snatched
the taffy and quickly swam away. Uncle Warren stared at
the fish. Then he stuck a piece of taffy onto his fishhook.

Uncle Warren tossed the hook and taffy into the
water. Suddenly, a fish jumped up and grabbed the hook.
"I've got one! I've got one!" yelled Uncle Warren.
"At last!"
Marcella grinned at her smiling uncle. "Yes!" she said.
"A good piece of taffy can do anything!"
