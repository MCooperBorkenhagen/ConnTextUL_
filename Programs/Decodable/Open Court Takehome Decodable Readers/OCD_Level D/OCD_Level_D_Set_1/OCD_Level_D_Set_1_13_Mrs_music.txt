Mrs. Music.

Every day Mrs. Music and her cat Stu went for a stroll.
"Look!" Mrs. Music said one day to Stu.  "Someone has
thrown a beautiful dish into the trash! That dish would
look grand on my table."

Mrs. Music rushed home and put the dish on her
table. The dish was beautiful, but the table was full.
"Stu," said Mrs. Music, "a cleaning is needed! I don't use
these candlesticks anymore.  I will throw them away."

Hugo was walking home from work when he
saw the candlesticks.
"What unusual candlesticks!" he said to himself.
"They must have come from a museum. Aunt Iris
would love them!"
Hugo picked up the candlesticks and took them
to his aunt.

Hugo put the candlesticks on Aunt Iris's shelf.
The candlesticks were beautiful, but the shelf was full.
"Hugo," said Aunt Iris, "a cleaning is needed! I don't
use this clock anymore. I have quite a few others. I will
throw this one away."

Later that day Mr. Quinlan came by with his cart.
"What a beautiful clock!" he cried. "It must be
valuable. I will take it home."
But Mr. Quinlan's cart was full. "A cleaning is
needed," Mr. Quinlan said. "I don't use this bugle
anymore. I will throw it away."

The next day Mrs. Music and Stu went for their walk.
"Oh, my!" said Mrs. Music when she saw the bugle. 
"Stu, look at that beautiful bugle! I wonder where
I can put it?"
