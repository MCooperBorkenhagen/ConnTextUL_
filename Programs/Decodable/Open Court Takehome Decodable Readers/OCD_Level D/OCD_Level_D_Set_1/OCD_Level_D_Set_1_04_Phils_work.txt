Phil's Work.

Phil and his dad chopped logs with axes. They
chopped in the hot sun.
"This is not a lot of fun," Phil said.

Phil wished for other work.
"Just watch, Pop," he said. "I'm going to be rich."
As he chopped thick logs, Phil had a plan for work.
I've got it! Corncob dolls!

When a job plan was wrong, Phil was not mad.
"It was an odd plan," he'd say. "Other work
will come along.

Some of Phil's plans would drop with a plop.
I've got it!
I'll help golfers!

But when work hit bottom with a splash, Phil
was not upset.
"It was an odd plan," he'd say. "Other work will
come along."

"Just watch, Pop," he'd say. "I'll have a plan that is not odd."
"Don't stop your odd plans, Phil," his pop would tell him as 
he got the ax. "But don't stop chopping logs."
