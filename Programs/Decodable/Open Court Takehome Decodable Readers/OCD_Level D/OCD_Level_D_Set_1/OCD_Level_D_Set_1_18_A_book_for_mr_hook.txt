A Book for Mr. Hook.

Once an old man named Mr. Hook lived by a brook
in the woods. Whenever the children played by the
brook, the old man yelled, "Stay away from my brook!"

"Why does he act like that?" Lucy asked her mother.
Lucy's mother said that Mr. Hook was blind. She
took a cloth and tied it across Lucy's eyes. "Here," she
said. "Maybe this will help you understand how Mr. 
Hook feels."

Lucy tried putting on her shoes. She could not even
find her foot.
Worst of all, Lucy could not read. "I don't know what
I would do if I could not read books!" said Lucy.

Lucy took off the cloth. She went to her bookshelf
and chose a book. "This is a good book," she said. "I'll
bet Mr. Hook would like it."
Lucy's mother understood. "Good idea!" she said.

Lucy and her mother took the book to Mr. Hook's 
house. "My teacher said I need to practice reading. May
I read my book to you?"
"What book?" yelled Mr. Hook.
"Peter Pan," said Lucy.
"Hmm," said Mr. Hook. "Well, okay ..."

Lucy read her book to Mr. Hook every day. One day,
the children came to play at the brook. "Why doesn't
Mr. Hook yell at us anymore?" they asked Lucy's mother.
"He's got a new friend," she said.
"Who?" the children asked.
"Peter Pan," said Lucy's mother.
