Paul, Aunt Maud, and Claude.

Paul's Aunt Maud owned a tiger named Claude. 
Claude had four big paws with sharp claws.
"Claude is really quite tame," said Aunt Maude.
"I have even taught him tricks."

Paul watched as Claude performed his tricks.
Claude could turn somersaults. He could balance on
a seesaw. He could even do laundry!
"He must be an awfully smart tiger," thought Paul.

"How do you get Claude to do these tricks?" asked Paul.
"I feed him well," said Aunt Maude. "He likes to gnaw on
sausages and raw cauliflower, and he loves to sip
buttermilk through a straw."

One day Aunt Maud looked distraught.
"Claude must be lost!" she said.
"I can help," said Paul.
Paul ran across Maud's lawn to a dairy farm.
"These cows look awfully scared," thought Paul.
"I'll bet Claude has been here."
He looked down and saw buttermilk paw
prints. He followed them to a nearby store.

Outside the store, Paul saw an open box of straws.
"Claude must have been here, too!" said Paul.
He followed the straws until he came to the
playground. There sat Claude on the seesaw.
"You must be hungry, Claude," said Paul cautiously.
Paul gave Claude some sausage. Then, with a trail of
raw cauliflower, he slowly led the tiger back home.

"You found him!" said Aunt Maud happily.
"You returned my pet tiger!"
Aunt Maud gave the exhausted Claude a kiss. Then she
turned to Paul. "Now can you help me find my pet lion?"
