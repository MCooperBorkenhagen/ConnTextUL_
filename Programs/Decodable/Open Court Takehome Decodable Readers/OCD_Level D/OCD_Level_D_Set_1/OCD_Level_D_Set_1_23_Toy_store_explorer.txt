Toy Store Explorer.

I like to explore Roy's wonderful toy store.
Here's a shiny kite made completely of red,
green, yellow, and blue foil. What a spectacular
sight that would be in the sky.

Now here's another fine choice. It's a model of 
a ship. It's a destroyer. Look at all the pieces. I'd
need glue to join them all.

Next is a an oil truck with a cab and trailer.
They come apart. It also has a flexible hose.

There are shelves of dolls. They come in all
shapes and sizes. Here's a princess in a royal gown.
Another doll has a voice that sounds almost human.

There's still so much to see. There are games,
books, jigsaw puzzles, and so many more toys. What
can I choose?

Well, here is my choice. It's a bright 
plastic coil that does all kinds of tricks.
