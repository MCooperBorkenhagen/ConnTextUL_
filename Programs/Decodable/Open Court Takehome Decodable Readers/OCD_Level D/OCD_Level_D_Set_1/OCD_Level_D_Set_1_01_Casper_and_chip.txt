Casper and Chip.

Once upon a time there was an old peddler named
Casper. He was very poor, but he had a grand donkey
called Chip. Casper loved Chip very much.
One day, on the way home, Casper and Chip
stumbled upon a pot of silver in a ditch by the path.
"Look, Chip!" said Casper, looking at the silver.

"This silver will make me a rich man!"
Casper put the silver in Chip's bag and went on.
In a little bit, Casper and Chip stumbled upon a
silver rock as big as a man's hat. "Look, Chip!" said
Casper. "This rock will make me a rich man!"

Casper put the rock in Chip's bag. The rock was
heavy. Poor Chip plodded along.
A little later, Casper and Chip stumbled upon a solid
silver box. "Look, Chip!" said Casper. "This box will
make me a rich man!"

Casper lifted the box onto Chip's back. But the box
was too heavy. Poor Chip fell to the ground.
"Get up, Chip!" cried Casper. "We must cross the 
river to get this silver home!" But Chip could not get
up. Casper took the pot of silver out of Chip's bag.

"There, Chip!" said Casper. "Now can you
get up?"
Chip still could not get up. Casper took the
silver rock out of his bag.
"There, Chip!" said Casper. "Now can you
get up?"
Chip still did not get up. Casper took the
silver box off his back.

"There, Chip!" said Casper. "There is nothing left
on your back. I will help you get up."
Chip got up. Then Chip and Casper crossed the
river home.
"Well, Chip," said Casper. "We have no silver, but
I'd much rather be a poor man with you than a rich 
man without you!"
