The Prince's Foolish Wish.

The Prince and the Worm.
Walter was a selfish prince. He liked only two 
things. He liked his dog Pooch, and he liked silver.
He had piles and piles of silver. Each night he would
lock his treasure room. Each morning he would
unlock his treasure room. Then he would stack and
restack the piles of silver.

One day Walter was playing with Pooch in the
garden. The sunlight sparkled on the water in the
pool. This made Walter wonder, "Wouldn't it be
wonderful if the pool were filled with silver?"
All of a sudden, Walter heard a splash.
He spotted a little worm in the water. He lifted
the worm from the pool. Walter was ready to toss
the worm away. Suddenly it spoke.

"Don't throw me away," said the worm.
"Why not?" asked Walter. "What is a little worm
worth to me?"
The worm said, "I am not worthless. I'm a
magic worm. I can grant you three wishes. What 
do you want?"
"I would like my pool filled with silver,"
said Walter.

"So it is," said the worm.
When the pool filled with silver, Walter was
unable to speak. "I am speechless," he said
to the worm.
"You have two more wishes," said the worm.
"But I must warn you to take care. Be careful
what you wish."
Walter heard only the words two more wishes.
The worm's warning was unheard. Walter quickly
made a second wish.

"I wish that everything I touch would turn
to silver," said Walter.
"That is not a wise wish," said the worm.
"Your job is to grant my wish," said Walter.
"You heard what I want."
"Your wish is granted," said the worm.
"Perhaps you will learn a lesson. Only a fool
makes foolish wishes."

Walter ran through the garden. He touched
chairs, the roses, and the stones on the path.
Everything turned to silver.
"It works! It works!" cried Walter. "Watch this!"
He put his hand under the water. Clink, clink,
clink! He heard the silver drip into a pile.

"Yes, it works," said the worm. "I will dig into the
soft earth. That is where I will be when you need me."
"I won't need you," snapped Walter. "I have all the
wealth I need. A wealthy prince does not need a
worthless little worm."

The Foolish Wish.
Walter rushed into his palace. He put his hand
on each thing he spied. Soon he had silver carpets,
silver tables, and a silver throne.
"I'm hungry," said Walter. "I will have lunch, then
I will spend all afternoon turning things to silver."

But Walter soon discovered his first problem.
Each bite he tried to eat turned into silver. He was
unable to eat anything. Soon he had a plate
of uneaten silver food. He felt much discomfort.

Walter returned to the garden. Pooch had a bone.
"Look, Pooch," said Walter. "We can play with a
silver bone."
Walter picked up the bone. It turned to silver.
He tossed the bone across the path. Pooch fetched
the bone and returned to Walter.
"Nice dog, Pooch," said Walter. He bent over to
pet Pooch on the head. In an instant, Pooch froze.
Instantly, Pooch turned to silver!"

"Pooch! Poor Pooch! Worm! Worm!
I need you!" cried Walter.
The little worm poked its head out of the
earth. "How can a worthless worm help
a wealthy prince?" asked the worm.

"Oh, worm, you were right. I made a foolish
wish. I can't eat. I turned poor Pooch to silver. I 
want to eat. I want Pooch to be furry again. I want
to return to the way I was."
"You have just one more wish," said the worm.
"Do you want to eat? Do you want Pooch back?
Try to be wise. Do not make an unwise wish.

This time Walter was careful. He stopped
to think. Then he said, "I wish that everything
would return to the way it was."
"Commendable. Your wish is granted," said
the worm.

"Arf, arf," said Pooch.
Drip, drip, splash, splash went the water.
"Let's eat!" said Walter. And he didn't
worry over his silver ever again.
