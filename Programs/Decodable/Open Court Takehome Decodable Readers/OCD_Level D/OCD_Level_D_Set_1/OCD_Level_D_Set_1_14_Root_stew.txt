Root Stew.

Scooter and Bruce lived in an old boot next to
a blue pool. Most of the time, Scooter's and
Bruce's lives went smoothly. During the day, they
snoozed inside the cool boot. At night, they
snooped for food.

The only time Scooter's and Bruce's lives did
not go smoothly was when the moon was bright.
When the moon was bright, they hid in the boot
and listened for Hunter's "Hoot, hoot, hoot."
They knew that "Hoot, hoot, hoot" meant that
Hunter was hungry. Mice were not safe when
Hunter was hungry.

Scooter thought it was his duty to do something
about Hunter. 
"Hunter always seems hungry," he said, "and he
always seems to be in a bad mood. Maybe Hunter
isn't getting anything nice to eat."

The next day, Scooter worked. Into a pot he tossed 
chopped roots, berries, and shoots. That night, before
the moon rose, Scooter crept over to Hunter's roost.
There, he left the pot of root stew.

As the moon rose, Scooter and Bruce listened. In
the distance, they heard Hunter's call. "Hoot, hoot,
hoot! Hoot, hoot, hoot!"
"Rats!" said Scooter gloomily. "He didn't like the
root stew."

Hunter flew closer and closer. "He's really in a bad
mood tonight," said Bruce. "He must hate root stew!"
Scooter listened hard. Then he squeaked with glee!
"Why, Hunter isn't calling 'Hoot, hoot, hoot!'" he
exclaimed. "Hunter is calling 'Stew, stew, stew!'"
