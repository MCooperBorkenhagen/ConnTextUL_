"I can make things appear, and I can
make things disappear. Watch very carefully!
When I say the magic phrase, this rabbit
will disappear."
"One, two, unbuckle my shoe."

"What went wrong? Maybe I was careless
with the magic phrase. I read my magic book.
Maybe I should reread it."

"I see my friends are not happy.
Don't be unhappy, friends. I have another
playful trick up my sleeve. A man has
disappeared, but he will reappear in this box."
"Three, four, unlock the door!"

Boooo. Get the hook! I want my money back!
"Oh, just my luck! How unlucky!
Maybe I spoke too slowly."

"Am I late?"
"Wait, friends. I am honest, not dishonest.
Let's rerun the disappearing rabbit trick.
This time I will close my eyes and say the phrase."
"Oh, unzip my lips! Maybe I used the 
wrong phrase. My fans have disappeared!"
