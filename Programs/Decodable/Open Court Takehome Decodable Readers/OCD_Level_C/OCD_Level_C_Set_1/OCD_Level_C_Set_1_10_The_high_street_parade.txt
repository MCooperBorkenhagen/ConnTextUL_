The High Street Parade.

It was Saturday. The kids were
playing in the park on High Street.
Margie said, "It's no fun to play on the swings and
slide all the time. Let's try to have a parade!"

"Let's dress up and
march to High Street Park!" cried Margie.
Then they raced away to get things for the
parade.

Margie got a drum
and a large cane. She
went stomping and
drumming. Then she 
marched to get
Gilbert.

Gilbert had a black cape and a fur top hat. He
made a bird with paper and placed it in the hat.
They marched to get Irene.

Irene got a lace dress for her cat, Maybell. Maybell
danced in a circle on her back legs. They marched
to get Steve.

Steve had skates that buzzed and a silver helmet.
He had a little flashlight to shine when he dodged
by.
They marched to get Val and Gail.

Val had nails to shake in a can. Then she strung
bells on her laces. Gail dangled chains and tapped a
mop. Shake, shake! Jingle, jingle! Clang, clang! Tap,
tap! Val and Gail made a band.

They had a fine parade! Margie raised her cane,
stomped, and drummed. Gilbert waved his hat with
the bird. Irene danced with Maybell.

Steve skated. Val and Gail played: Shake, shake!
Jingle, jingle! Clang, clang! Tap, tap! They marched
up High Street all the way to the park.

Everyone came to the parade and clapped
and waved. They yelled and screamed with pride.

The children rested in the shade after the parade.
Margie said, "That was fun. We gave the best
parade High Street has ever seen!"
"What can we plan for next Saturday?" asked
Irene.
"I think we should have a circus!" said Gilbert.
