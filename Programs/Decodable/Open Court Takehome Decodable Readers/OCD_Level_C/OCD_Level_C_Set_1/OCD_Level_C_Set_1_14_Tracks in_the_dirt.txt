Tracks in the Dirt.

Pete and Lee were camping with Gramps.
They spied some marks in the dirt.

"Look! Deer tracks," said Lee. "Let's see
where they go. May we follow them, Gramps?"
"Don't hike too far," said Gramps.
"You'll be late for lunch."

Pete and Lee grabbed the horn to signal
Gramps and a full canteen to use in case they
were thirsty.
"Don't fret, Gramps," said Pete. "We know
the rules."

The children hiked and hiked,
but no deer appeared.

On the trail they came across a black snake,
two chipmunks, three puny spiders in a web,
a green frog with spots, a smelly skunk, and a slow
snail in its shell. But they didn't see a single deer.

"It's time to turn back," said Pete. "It's getting late.
No deer today. Gramps will be sad."
The children hiked back to camp. But what a
surprise they had. 
"Look who dropped in for lunch!" said Gramps.
