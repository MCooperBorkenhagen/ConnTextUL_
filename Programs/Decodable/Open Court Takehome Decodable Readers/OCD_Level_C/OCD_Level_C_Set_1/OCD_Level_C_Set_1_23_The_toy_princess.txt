The Toy Princess.

Joy was a dusty doll in a small toy store.
She was dressed like a princess and had a crown.
Joy had been in the toy shop for a very long time.

"No one will every buy you," said Roy, a
cowboy doll. "Your royal dress is soiled, and
your joints need oil."

"Yes," said Troy, a spoiled clown doll. "You do
not make funny noises like me. Boys and girls
will avoid you."

"Wait!" said a voice from the back of the shelf.
"You should not tease and annoy Joy. There is a 
boy or a girl for every toy."
Joy rejoiced and hoped this was true.

The very next day, a boy came and looked in
every corner of the toy shop. Finally, he made a 
choice.

"That princess doll will be perfect for my sick
little sister," he said, pointing to Joy, and he paid
with some coins. "I think she will enjoy this royal
toy," said the boy.
