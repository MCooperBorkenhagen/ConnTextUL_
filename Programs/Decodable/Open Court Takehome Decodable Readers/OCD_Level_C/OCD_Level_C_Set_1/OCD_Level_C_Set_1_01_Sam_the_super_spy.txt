Sam the Super Spy.

"Where is my newspaper?" said Dad.
"I placed it on the table. But now it is not here.
Something is funny. I think I need some help."

"Sam the spy to the rescue," said Sam.
"I will help you find the paper, Dad. I am a
good spy."
"Maybe you took it to the backyard," said Sam.
"No," said Dad. "I did not go outside."

"Let's check with Mom. Maybe she is reading
the paper," said Sam.
No luck! Mom had not seen the paper.
"Don't worry, Dad. I know I will solve this
mystery," Sam said firmly. "I am a super spy!"

Sam looked in the kitchen. He looked
in the closet and on the front porch. He
peeked in the tool shed and under the sink.

"This is an awful puzzle," said Sam with a
sorry voice. "I have searched all about
without a clue."

"That's all right," said Dad as he rose
from his chair. "I can buy a new one."
"Jump for joy!" said Sam with delight.
"You have solved the mystery, Dad.
Look what's on your chair!"
