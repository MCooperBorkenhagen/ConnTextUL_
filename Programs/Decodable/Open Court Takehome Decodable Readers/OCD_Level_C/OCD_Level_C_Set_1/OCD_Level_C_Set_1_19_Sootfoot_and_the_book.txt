Sootfoot and the Book.

Matt looked at all of the books on the bookshelf.
"This one should be good," he said to himself.

He took the book to his room to read. His cat
Sootfoot followed him. 
"Scat, Sootfoot," said Matt. "I would like to read
this book."

Sootfoot did not scat. So Matt took his 
jacket with the hood from the hook. He took
his book, and he went through the door.

In the woods, Matt sat under the tree
by the brook. It was a good spot to read
a book. But Sootfoot had followed him.

"Look, Sootfoot," said Matt. "I would like
to read my book. I cannot play with you."
Sootfoot stood looking sad. Matt felt bad.

"I know, Sootfoot!" said Matt. "If you are good, I
could read my book to you!"
So Matt and Sootfoot sat under the tree by the
brook. Matt read his book while Sootfoot took a nap
on his lap.
