The Bread Shop.

Frank is opening a bread shop on the
town square. He will serve warm, fresh bread.
Frank will make the bread from scratch.
He will use blends of grains.

His bread will be warmer and fresher
than any you have tried. His bread will be
the warmest and freshest on the block.

Best of all, Frank's bread will come in
many shapes -- a slim slab, a split loaf,
or a striped twist.

Some of his breads will be sweet and fluffy.
Some breads will be small and spicy.
Some will be crunchy and filled with nuts.

Some breads will be spread with butter,
jam, or jelly. All of them will be yummy and
worth the price.

What? You don't like warm bread spread with
jam? You don't want tasty bread filled with nuts?
Don't worry! Frank also serves the coldest, freshest
skim milk on the street.
