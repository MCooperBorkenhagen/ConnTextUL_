The Fake Snake.

Vic made a fake snake from paper.
"A snake is just a tail and a face," said Vic.
"This large snake was fun to make."

Vic had his snake when he went to the lake.
He saw Gail on the trail. Vic waved at Gail and ran
to catch up.

But Vic's backpack was not shut all the way.
The fake snake fell into the lake.

Vic's fake snake bobbed in the waves. The
gentle waves made the snake start to wiggle
and shake.

"I like the way your fake snake swims in the
waves," said Gail.
Just then, it started to rain. Vic and Gail ran
away to escape the rain.

"That fake snake can stay in the center of the
lake," said Vic. "I can make a different snake."
