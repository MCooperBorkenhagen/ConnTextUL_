Claude the Tiger.

Maude has a pet tiger. Its name is Claude.
Claude's paws have sharp claws.

"But Claude is really tame," said Maude.
"I have taught him some tricks."

Paul watched Claude draw, tumble,
and play catch.
"Claude must be awfully smart.
What makes him smart, Maude?" asked Paul.

"I feed Claude sausages and cauliflower," said
Maude. "And he loves to sip buttermilk with a straw."
"What a strange diet for a tiger," thought Paul.

"Now it's time for you lunch, Paul,"
said Maude. "Here is a plate of dinosaur 
scales with salted walnut sauce."

"Mmmm! My favorite!" squawked Paul.
