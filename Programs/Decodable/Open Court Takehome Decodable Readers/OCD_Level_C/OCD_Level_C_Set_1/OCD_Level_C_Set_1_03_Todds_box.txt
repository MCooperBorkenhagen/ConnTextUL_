Todd's Box.

"What's in the box?" asks Ann.
"Can we knock on the box?"

"Is it string in a knot? Is it a big,
white rock?" asks Max.
"Here is a little hint," says Todd.
"A pet is in the box. It is Hip-Hop."

"Rabbits hop," says Ann. "I bet Hip-Hop
is a rabbit. Is a little rabbit in the box?"
"Hip-Hop is not a rabbit," says Todd.

"Is it an insect? Crickets hop," says Max.
"Is it a cricket in the box? Is Hip-Hop a cricket?

"Hip-hop is not a cricket," says Todd.
"Hip-Hop is from a pond and can swim.
Hip-Hop has spots. Hip-Hop says 
ribbet, ribbet, ribbet."

"A frog is from a pond and can swim!" says Max.
"A frog has spots and can hop!" says Ann.
"Ribbet!" says Hip-Hop.
