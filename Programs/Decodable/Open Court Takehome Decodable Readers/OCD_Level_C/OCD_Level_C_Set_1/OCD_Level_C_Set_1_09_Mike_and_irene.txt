Mike and Irene.

I am Mike. My wife is Irene. My wife and I like to
fly in the skies on a bright, pretty day.

Irene likes to glide across the sky.
We glide for miles and miles.

Irene flies high, turns wide, and then
dives, dives, dives. I may feel fright, but I just try
to smile.

When Irene and I fly high enough, Irene writes
with white lines in the sky. She tells everyone to
visit my bike shop. Will they come? They might.
Mike's bike shop.

Open nine to five.
When you ride your bike or fly a kite, you
might spy a plane flying through the sky.

Wave and smile. It might be Irene and me.
