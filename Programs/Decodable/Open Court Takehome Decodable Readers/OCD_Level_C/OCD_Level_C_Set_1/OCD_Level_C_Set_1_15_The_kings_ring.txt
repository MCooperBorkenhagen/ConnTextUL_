The King's Ring.

Once upon a time, there was a wise king.
He was nice to those in his kingdom.

The king had a ruby ring. When
he wanted to think, he would say,
"Bring my ruby ring!" Then he would
put on the ring.

He would think. He would read. He
would rub his ring. At last, he would
tell the citizens what to do.

The king never lied. He was
fair and wise. The citizens truly
loved him. But one cruel man did not love him.

That man was Penrod. 
Perod wanted to be
King. Penrod had 
a cruel plan.

After a few days, Penrod hid by the road.
He waited for the king. He planned to
spring on the king and take his ruby ring.

"Hand over the ruby ring," said
Penrod.
"The ring will make me wise.
Then I will use it to be the king."
"You may take the ring," said
the king. "Here it is."

Penrod put on the 
ring. "I am the ruler of
the land," said Penrod.
So Penrod quickly put 
the king in jail.

Every night Penrod rubbed
the jewel. He rubbed and
rubbed. He refused to think.
He refused to read. The ruby
ring did not help him.

He was not 
wise. He was not
fair. He was just mean. The
citizens were not happy.

The citizens had a plan to 
rescue the king. They went to the
jail and set the real king free.
"You are the real king," they said.
"Take back the ruby ring!"

"Thank you, my heroes,
but I do not need the ruby ring,"
said the king. "I know that a ring
will not make me wise. I need to 
think. I need to read.
That makes me wise."

The king spoke to Penrod. "You
can keep the ring," he said. "A ring
will not make a king."
