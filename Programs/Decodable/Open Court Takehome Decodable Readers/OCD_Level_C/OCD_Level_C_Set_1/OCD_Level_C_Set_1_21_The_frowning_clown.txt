The Frowning Clown.

In a brown house, down at the edge of
town, lives a short, stout clown. The
clown's name is Brownie.

Brownie was sad. He felt left out.
He did not laugh or smile like the
other clowns. He did not run and
bound. All Brownie did was frown.

One day, the clowns found Brownie
and tried to make him smile. They made
silly sounds, but Brownie only frowned.

They squirted water from funny flowers,
but Brownie still frowned. The clowns did
not know how to grow a smile from a frown.

Then a little clown gave Brownie a big hug.
"I don't care an ounce if you do feel low and
frown," said the little clown."
"I am still proud to have you around! You should not
pout and feel left out."

This made Brownie happy. He smiled
and laughed out loud. Now Brownie is a
happy clown! The crowd at the show
loves him!
