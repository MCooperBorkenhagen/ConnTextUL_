The Blimp Crew.

On a nice June day, a blimp flew over
the game. On the blimp was an ad for Grandma
Sue's special stew. That's the stew with tuna in it!

The blimp crew could see the game. One team
had red caps. The home team had bright blue socks.

The blimp crew could see the band, too.

The flutes made beautiful music. The drum went
boom. The tuba blew a few bad notes.

The blimp had to return home by noon.

But the crew knew that the Blue Sox were 
winning. They could see a clue. 
What super news!
