Dinner for Hardtop.

Hardtop lumbers through the grass.
He is hunting for tender ferns.
Ferns are a perfect dinner for a turtle.
Yum! Yum!

Yes! Some tender ferns are just past the rock.
This is just what Hardtop wants.
Hardtop is puzzled. First, he must get past
the rock. Perhaps he can circle the rock.

Oh, no! Hardtop flips on his back.
He is startled. He wiggles and jiggles
his legs, but he does not budge.
He is stuck on his back at the edge of the rock.

A little bird zigzags, then lands on the rock.
It starts to chirp and sing.
A girl is filling a jar with nuts and ginger.

"That chirping bird is not far," she says.
The girl spots the bird on the rock.
Then she spots Hardtop.

"You sad little turtle," says the girl. She turns
Hardtop on his legs. "There, isn't that better?"
Hardtop starts his trip circling past the rock.
He still wants the ferns for dinner.
