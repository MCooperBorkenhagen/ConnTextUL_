The Wise Monkey.

Two sly cats had stolen a piece of cheese from
their master's table together. It was a nice big piece
of cheese. But they had an argument on how to
divide it. Each cat was afraid that the other might
get a bigger piece.

Finally, they asked the judge to help them
divide the cheese evenly.
The judge was a very wise monkey. He broke
the piece of cheese in two. He placed the pieces
on a scale and watched carefully. One side of the
scale dipped lower than the other side.

"This piece must be bigger," said the monkey.
"That's not even." So the monkey took a bite of the
bigger piece of cheese. 
But now the opposite side of the scale was
lower.

"Aha!" said the monkey. "Now this section is
bigger." And he took a bite of the second piece
of cheese.
"Stop! Stop!" the two cats howled. "Just give
us back what is left and we will be happy!"

"Fair is fair," replied the monkey. "The pieces
must be exactly the same size."
And so the monkey kept weighing and nibbling.
He nibbled first from one side, and then from the
other, over and over again.
Finally, the two sides of the scale were perfectly
even. The two pieces of cheese were exactly the
same size.

"Now this is fair!" said the monkey. "I will take
these pieces as a fee for my opinion."
After gobbling them down, the monkey
pounded his gavel and said, "Remember this
decision. Case dismissed!"
