Heroes.

Smoke rose from up the road.
Joe rode his bike to see why.

"Oh, no," said Joe. "The Nolans' home
is burning, and I know that no one is
home."

"Mom, smoke is coming from the
Nolans' home" said Joe.
Mom spoke on the phone, "There is
a fire at 222 Grove Road. Please hurry!"

The firefighters go, go, go! They slide on the
pole. They put on their yellow coats and jump
in the fire truck.

Joe sees the firefighters soak the
Nolans' home. The water flow stops
the fire. The Nolans' home is safe.

"Mom, those men and women are
real heroes," says Joe.
"So are you, Joe," says Mom.
