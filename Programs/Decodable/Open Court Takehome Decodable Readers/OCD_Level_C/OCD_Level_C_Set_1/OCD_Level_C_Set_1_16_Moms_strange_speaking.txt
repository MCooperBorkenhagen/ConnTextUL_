Mom's Strange Speaking.

My mom speaks in a strange way.
She says silly things.
"Pick up your room, Brad," she says to me.

"Will you dress the chicken, please?"
she asks my dad.
"I will warm up the car," she tells us all.

"We are throwing a party," she says to me.
"I'll give you a buzz," she tells her friend.

When she is in the kitchen, she sometimes says,
"Beat the eggs twice." "Cream the butter."

"Shred the carrots."
"Fold the egg whites."
"I'll drop you off," she reminds my sister.
What does she mean when she says 
these tricky things?

"I've had enough," I scream. "I'm going to catch
some flies. And then I'll practice stealing bases."
