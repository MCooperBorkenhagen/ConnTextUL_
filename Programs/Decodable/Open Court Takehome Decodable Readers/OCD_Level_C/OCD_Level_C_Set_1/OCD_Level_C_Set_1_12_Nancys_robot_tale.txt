Nancy's Robot Tale.

Nancy wrote a robot tale. This big robot's name
is Unit One. Unit One is huge. It makes the human
look quite puny.

This little robot's name is Unit Five.
Unit Five is Unit One's nephew.

On a hot day, Unit Five can use
a few mugs of ice cubes for fuel.
The ice cubes give Unit Five energy.

Then, Unit Five uses the mugs to make music.

Unit One does not like mug music.
Unit One and Unit Five argue. But Unit
One can quickly stop the music.

Crunch. Crunch.
Huge Unit One uses a few mugs for fuel.
This time Unit One has energy ...
and peace and quiet.
