Aloha Good-Bye, Aloha Hello.

Aloha Good-Bye.
Dear Arie,
I will never like Hawaii. I
miss you too much. I wish 
I still lived next to you.
Mom said it might help me
to send pictures and write
to you. Please write back.
Bobbie.
My old house. Your house.

Dear Arie,
Aloha! (a low ha) Aloha 
can mean good-bye or hello.
Please visit me in Hawaii.
Write soon. Aloha good-bye,
Bobbie.

Dear Arie,
I love swimming in the ocean!
Come play twin sisters, like our
moms, as we did before.
Aloha good-bye, 
Bobbie.
twins.

Remember
our boat ride?

Dear Arie,
We study Hawaii in school.
Hawaii is in the middle of the big
Pacific Ocean. You will have to fly over
the ocean to visit me. Aloha,
Bobbie.

Dear Arie,
Maybe the humpback
whales will be visiting Hawaii
when you visit. Hump, bump,
lump. Remember how we
liked to rhyme everything?

Dear Arie,
I feel silly. Hunny and I 
take hula lessons. Hula is the
dance of Hawaii. Hunny is a girl 
in my hula class. Hunny likes
to rhyme things, too.
Hula-Doola she calls me.
When will you visit so I can
say Aloha hello?
Bobbie.

Aloha Hello.
Dear Arie,
We eat pineapple every day.
When it rains, and the sun is out,
we call the rain pineapple mist.
You can play in pineapple mist.
Bobbie.
Us in the sprinkler.

Dear Arie,
Hunny and I hiked to a 
dried volcano. Do you want
to see a volcano when you
visit? Aloha,
Bobbie.

Dear Arie,
I told Hunny how we play
twin sisters, and I told her
that our moms are real twins.
Sometimes Hunny and I play
that we are sisters. Is that
ok with you? Write soon.
Bobbie.

Dear Arie,
This is what I will put 
around your neck when
you get here
next week.
It's called
a lei (lay).
It smells 
good. I can
hardly wait
to see you.
Bobbie.

Dear Arie,
Here is a picture of us dancing
the hula. I am so glad you came
to Hawaii. Hunny had fun with you,
too. Next time, I will visit you in
California! Aloha good-bye! Soon
it will be Aloha hello again.
Bobbie.
