I Want.

I Want.
I want lots of toys.
I want crates of ice cream.
I want gum. I want cookies. I want lots of treats.
I want everything in the whole, wide world.

I want a kitty. I want a puppy. I want a fish.
I want a pet bear.
I want ten cents.

I want to see a movie every day in a row
for a whole year.
I want to go to the puppet show and sit in
the best seat.
I want to watch TV until my eyes fall out.

I want to go swimming in a swimming pool.
I want to go on a wild sled ride in the snow
down a big steep hill.
I want to go to a beach with lots of white
sand and blue water.

I want everything in the whole, wide world.
I want everyone in the whole, wide world to
know me.
I want to be in my own movie.
I want my own band.
I want to sing in my own video.

I want to go to the zoo.
I want my own tiger.
I want to go to a place that is very high.
I want to jump rope and play Double 
Dutch better than anyone.

Sharing.
I want everything in the whole, wide world.
I want it all just for me.

I don't want anyone else to have anything I want.
I want to be the boss over everyone. Everything in
the whole, wide world will be for me.

If I want it, no one else can have it.

"You are so mean, Sally Sue. You are so
selfish. If I had candy, I would share with you.
If I had toys, I would play with you. If my 
mom took me swimming, I would ask if you
could come, too. You are my friend.

"I am?"

"Yes. It is fun to play together. It is fun to share.
It is fun to think about someone besides yourself.
It is fun to have a friend, Sally Sue."

"You are right," said Sally Sue. "It is fun to have
a friend. To share and share and share. I am glad
we are friends. Are you?"

We want!
