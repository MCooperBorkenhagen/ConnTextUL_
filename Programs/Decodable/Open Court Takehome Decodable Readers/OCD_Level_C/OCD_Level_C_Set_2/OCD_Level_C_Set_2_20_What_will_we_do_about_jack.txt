Where Is That Hound?
He's not in his doghouse.
Where is that hound? Where can he be?
Just turn around.

He's not in his doghouse.
And he's not in the bedroom.
Where is that hound? Where can he be?
Just turn around.

He's not in his doghouse. He's not in the
bedroom. And he's not in the bathroom.
Where is that hound? Where can he be?
Just turn around.

He's not in his doghouse. He's not in the
bedroom. He's not in the bathroom. And
he's not in the hallway.
Where is that hound? Where can he be?
Just turn around.

He's not in his doghouse. He's not in the bedroom. 
He's not in the bathroom. He's not in the hallway.
And he's not in the kitchen.
Where is that hound? Where can he be?

He's not in his doghouse. He's not in the bedroom. 
He's not in the bathroom. He's not in the hallway.
He's not in the kitchen. And he's not on the porch.

Jack just lifted up his head and looked very sad.
"Arf! Arf! Arf!" is all he said.
