Hugo Quinn of the Daily Tribune.

Where's the Parade?
It was a quiet summer day. It was hot and
humid. Hugo Quinn had quite a lot to do.

Hugo wrote for the Daily Tribune newspaper.
He wrote the human interest stories. Hugo's
human interest stories were quite fun to read.
Hugo liked to amuse.

Hugo spoke with the public each day. This is
the way he came up with his stories. Today a man
told Hugo there was music on Cue Avenue. This
was quite odd.

Cue Avenue was a quiet avenue. Why did it 
have music today? Hugo went quickly to Cue
Avenue. "What a story for the Tribune!"
Hugo said to himself.

There was indeed music on Cue Avenue!
The music was quite loud. "It must be a
parade!" said Hugo. "This will be quite a story!"

Hugo waited. He waited quite a while. Then he
went over to the huge home at the end of the
street. The music was coming from there! Was the
parade inside the home?

No! It was just Mrs. Quill. The music in her
huge home was turned up quite loud. "Do you
like my music?" asked Mrs. Quill.
"Yes, Mrs. Quill," said Hugo. "But is there no
parade here?"
"A parade on Cue Avenue?" asked Mrs. Quill.
"No, not today. And you may quote me!"
"Thank you, Mrs. Quill," said Hugo. "But now I
must go."

There's the Parade.
Hugo came to the end of Cue Avenue. He was
sad and blue. He had no story for the paper.
"Now where will I go?" Hugo asked himself.
He rested for a few moments. Lunch was what
he needed. "After I eat, I will be ready to find a
story," he said to himself.

Hugo went to a diner on Cumin Street. He got
cucumber salad and a cheese sandwich. Quentin,
the waiter, said to Hugo, "What a humid day!"
"Yes," said Hugo, "I think it may be the most
humid day of the summer!"

"Why do you look so blue?" asked Quentin.
"I still have no story for today!" said Hugo.
"That is quite sad," said Quentin. "But maybe
you can write about the parade!"

"There is no parade today," muttered Hugo.
"It was just Mrs. Quill on Cue Avenue.
She plays her music quite loudly!"

"No, not Mrs. Quill," said Quentin. "There will
be a parade here on Cumin Street!"
"I don't believe it," muttered Hugo. And then
he was quiet. He ate his cucumber salad and
cheese sandwich.

"Hugo! It really is a parade! And it's quite huge!"
screamed Quentin.
Hugo got out a quarter. "If this lands on tails,
then I will believe you," said Hugo.
The music got even louder.

The quarter landed. It was tails! Hugo turned around
just in time. A huge parade was passing the diner!
"Now you have quite a story!" said Quentin. "The
Tribune will really like this!"
Hugo was quite amused. "May I quote you?"
he asked.
