Fox and the Grapes.

Sweet Grapes.
Fox went on a trip. He ran and ran in soft grass.

The grass got hot. And Fox got hot. Fox
wanted a rest. Fox wanted a drink.

Fox came to a glen. He stopped and sniffed.
He got a whiff of a sweet smell.

Fox spotted fat, red grapes on a trellis.
Fox licked his lips. "Mmmm. Fat, red grapes.
Fat, red grapes are the best."

Fox stuck his neck up, and up, and up.
But Fox did not get the grapes.

Fox hopped up and snapped,
and hopped up and snapped. But
his lips missed the fat, red grapes.

Fox backed up and ran and jumped. He did not
get the grapes. He whipped around and ran and
jumped again. Fox still did not get the grapes.

"I can get the grapes," rasped Fox. He
picked up a twig and banged the trellis.
Wham! Wham! Wham! The trellis trembled,
but Fox did not get the grapes.

Sour Grapes.
Fox got a rock and tossed it up at the
fat, red grapes. "I can knock them off," Fox
grinned. But Fox did not toss rocks well.
He missed and did not get the grapes.

Fox stacked bricks to stand on but fell off.
Fox huffed and puffed, but he still did not 
get the fat, red grapes.

Fox got mad. He stamped and tramped. He
grunted and grumbled. He ranted and panted.

Fox made one last hop. But he felt
sick and very hot.

Fox stopped jumping and hopping to shake his
fist at the fat, red grapes and grumble, "I am glad I
cannot get the grapes. They are sour and bad!"

Fox went on with his trip.
For some, if they cannot
have a thing, it must be bad.
