The Train Trip.

Animals on the Loose.
Toot! Toot!
"Oh, no! A blue moose is loose in the
caboose!" cries Fletcher, the first conductor.

"Loose moose! Loose moose!" screams
Kristen, the other conductor. "There is a blue
moose on the loose."
"What can we do with the moose loose
in the caboose" asks Fletcher.

"A moose cannot take a trip on a train," says
Kristen. "The moose must go! The moose needs
to leave."
Fletcher helps the moose out of the caboose.

"Bye-bye, blue moose!" yell Fletcher and Kristen.
Toot! Toot! The train clicks and clacks on the track.
"Oh, no!" cries Kristen. "A gray goose flew in 
the caboose."

Clip, Clop. So you think that might be the
moose on the roof?" asks Fletcher.
"Didn't the moose jump off the caboose?"
asks Kristen.
"Well, I can see a moose and a goose," says
Fletcher.
"A smelly goose is loose in the caboose.
A smelly moose hangs on the roof."
"A raccoon!" Kristen shrieks.

"A raccoon?" asks Fletcher. "I see just a moose
and a goose."
"Maybe the raccoon is on the roof," says Kristen.
"Quick, let's go up the steps and check the
roof," says Fletcher.

"I see gray smoke in the sky," says Kristen. "But 
no raccoon,"
"Let's go back inside the caboose," says Fletcher.
"Wait, I see a skunk."
"A skunk?" asks Kristen. "Does it have white 
stripes on its back?"
"No," says Fletcher. "Its fur is black and brown."

"That's the raccoon," says Kristen,
Fletcher smiles and shrugs. "I think we must
take the moose, the goose, and the raccoon."
"Why?" asks Kristen.
"I believe these three animals will like the
last train stop," says Fletcher.

The Last Stop.
Toot! Toot! The train slowly climbs a steep
cliff.  Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug. Fletcher glances
out the window. Kristen writes a few notes.

The huge moose stumbles back on the
goose. The gray goose honks and chomps the
raccoon's toe. The raccoon scrambles and
charges out of the caboose.

Toot! Toot! Toot! Toot!
"It is past noon," says Kristen. "Soon we will
make the last stop."
"Where's the raccoon?" asks Fletcher.
I don't know," Kristen says. "Maybe we can
see it from the window.

The train slows to a stop at the edge of the city.
The wheels grind and screech. The blue moose jumps
off the caboose. The gray goose exits the caboose.
"Last stop," cries Fletcher. "Where is the moose?"
"Where is the goose?" asks Kristen.

"Let's get off and check," says Fletcher.
"I see a zebra and an elephant," says Kristen.
"But no blue moose."
"I see a giraffe," says Fletcher. "But no gray
goose or raccoon."

"Here is the moose, and here is the goose,"
says Kristen.
"Here is the raccoon," says Fletcher.
"Hooray! We're here - at the zoo!" scream
Kristen and Fletcher.
Toot! Toot!
