Alphabet Zoo.

A, B, C.
"I love you," Mom smiles as she tucks me in bed.
"Tomorrow we go to the zoo, just me and you."

I wonder what we will see and do when
we go to the zoo.

I must be asleep! This must be a dream! I see a b!
Not a bee! The letter b!
I hear a b buzz! How can this be?
I just saw a b! Or was it a d?

I see gs hanging on trees. It's strange to see
swingin gs in a gusting August breeze!

Near my ear, I hear loud vowels howling,
"A! E! I! O! U!"

From nowhere, L leaps over Little Bo Peep.
"Please don't weep, silly Bo Peep. I will help
you find your sheep," I say.

Letters are free in my alphabet zoo. They 
sound as they please and do as they do.

Sometimes letters like to think. An m and I watch
a stone sink. A w waves in the water and winks.

I hear a short sound ask a long one, "What
happens when two vowels go walking?
The long sound laughs and sings
along, "The first one does the talking!"

X, Y, Z.
I stare at a bear sitting by a c by the sea. The
bear is eating an eclair. That bear should share!

Oh, no! Blooms boom! Ps explode!
Why zooms by on a broom.

"Won't you wake up?" X asks.
"No, I want to stay and sleep," I say.
"Go away," Y replies.
I shut my eyes very tightly.

"Wake up, Ray!" Mom shouts.
I hear a z zoom by, but it's just a buzzing fly.
I wake up and say, "I'm just in my bed!"

Cows moo. What? Who? A cool, morning
breeze blows. 
I will see you at the alphabet zoo!
