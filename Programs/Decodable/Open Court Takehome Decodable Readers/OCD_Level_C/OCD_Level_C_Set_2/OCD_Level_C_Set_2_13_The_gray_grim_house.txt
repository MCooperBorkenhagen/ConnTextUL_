The Gray, Grim House.

Grace Must Go.
"Grace," Mom said.
"Yes, Mom."
"Grace, I need you to go to Grandma's house."
"But, Mom, the rain!"
"Grandma needs you. Take the pants, two
plums, some stamps, and Grandma's brush. Don't
be scared, Grace. Nothing will harm you."

Gray, gray, gray.
Grim, grim, grim.
Grandma's house is a scary house.
Grace is stuck. Mom trusts her. She must go.

"Grace, take your drum. Bring your snake, Blake.
Grandma will be glad to see you both. You can show
Grandma how much Blake has grown.

Grace tramps by the train track. High in the
sky a small flock of ducks flies over.

Grandma's house is on a cliff.
Grace sniffs the air. She smells smog. Mist hangs
over the land.
Grace passes by a truck stuck in the mud. In the
back of the truck is a stack of lamps.

Grace hears the rain splash. She stands
and stares. She is glad Blake is with her.

The stairs up the cliff are steep. Grace sees
Grandma's great, gray, grim house. She climbs the 
stairs. Blake slips and slogs behind her. Blake likes the
rain, but what a trick it is for a snake to climb stairs!

"Grandma, Are You Home?"

"Grandma! Grandma! Are you home?" Grace calls.
The house is dark. Grace is scared.
"Grandma! Grandma! Are you here?"

The house is dark. Grace hears a drip. Grace
hears someone coming. Grace is scared. Grace is
glum. In the great, grim house everything is gray.
Grace trips!

Grace sees a flash. She hears a smash.
Where is Grandma?

"Grandma? Grandma?"
Now Grace smells a smell.
"Mmmmm! What smells good?"

The dark clouds open up. The sun shines in.
A glint of shiny sun falls on a great, green plant.
The great, green plant is mint. It smells so good.

"Grace, is that you?"
Grandma's voice is so sweet. Grace does not
know why she felt scared. Sometimes scared
just grips and grasps you. Scared can make you
glum. But with the help of a sweet voice, scared
can melt like sleet and snow.

"Hi, Grandma, are you well?"
"Hi, Grace. I am so glad you came. You are so
sweet. My house was too grim and gray and glum
to be alone in. But now that you are here with
me, I feel glad. Did you bring my stamps and
brush? Would you like some lunch? Oh, Grace, I
am so glad to see you."
