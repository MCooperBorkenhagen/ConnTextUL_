Jack's Trip.

Something Different.
"Day after day it's the same, same thing," said Jack
to Jill. "First we take the pail up the hill to the lake.
On the way back, I stumble. You come tumbling after.
Then we have a snack, and every day it's cake. Day
after day it's the same, same thing. Let's go away."

"I think I'll stay," said Jill. "But you go, okay?
Just send a letter every day."

Jack made his plans.
"What should I take?" he said to himself.
"A hat in case of rain. A scarf in case it is cold.
And paper and pens (for letters to Jill)."

The plane trip was long. Jack started a letter.
"Dear Jill," it said. "I am on a plane."
(That's as far as he got - then he slept.)

Jack got off the plane in London.
He went to a park. He went to a palace. He
waited in vain for a glimpse of the prince's face.
A cat named Ben gave him a drink in a thin, pink
cup. Jack drained the cup.
"This is nice, but I must go," said Jack. Jack waved
his hand and Ben waved his tail.

Jack's next stop was Paris, France. He sat at a 
table and felt the warm April air. He had lunch
with a painter who said he had a nice face.

Jack's next stop had no cars. Jack took a boat
from place to place. The sun lit up the water and lit
up the docks. Jack stared into the water. He stared
so hard he fell in! He was saved by a bunch of
ducks. He was wet, but did not complain.

Dear Jill,
Here I am in Spain!
Today I watched the dancers.
They clap and stamp,
and wave their arms.
They snap their fingers with a
click click clack. I will practice
and practice when I get back.
Best wishes,
Jack.

The Best Place.
Then Jack went far, far away. He gazed out
at lots of sand and lots of sun.
"It is different. That's what I came for."
He liked the sun and the sand. With water,
it would be perfect.

So Jack went to a place with sand and sun
and water. He waded. He swam. He sailed.
He made sand shapes with a spade and a pail.
The sun never failed to blaze.

Then Jack said, "I need a snack."
He went to a snack place and picked the cake.
"I like this cake," said Jack. "But not as much as
the cake I have with Jill."

Then Jack felt rather sad.
"I miss the pail. And I miss the hill and my
lake. I miss my snack with Jill. I liked all the
places I visited, but I think I will go back."

Jack got on the next plane. When it landed,
Jack ran fast. He ran up the hill and past the
lake. He ran, yelling, "Jill, I'm back!"

"I got the letter," Jill said. "Can we dance that
dance?"
"Yes," said Jack. "Let's dance!"
Jack and Jill snapped and stamped. They turned
and clapped.
Then Jack said, "Let's have a snack!" And they
had cake, in fact.
At the end of the day, Jack said to Jill:
"I liked all the nice places, but I've had my fill.
It's just not the same without you, Jill."
