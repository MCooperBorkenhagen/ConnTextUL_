Mack and Nick.

Mack.
An ant named Mack has a black backpack.
His best friend Nick has a pet named Tick.

Mack is on a pick-up stick.
The stick is in a stack.

The sticks are on a mat.
The mat is tan and black.

Mat hops from the pick-up stick
but hops without his pack.

Mack must have his snack.
His snack is in his pack.

But his pack and snack are on the stick,
and the stick is in the stack.

Help! Help! Help!

Mack's friend, Nick,
can help Mack with the stick.

Nick picks a stick and kicks the stack,
and they get Mack's pack.

Nick and Mack are glad!
Glad to kick the stack,
to get the stick,
to have the pack,
to have the snack,
back from the pick-up stick.

Mack and Nick are glad to nibble, sip, and pick.
They sit back and have their snack and pass a
bit to Tick.
