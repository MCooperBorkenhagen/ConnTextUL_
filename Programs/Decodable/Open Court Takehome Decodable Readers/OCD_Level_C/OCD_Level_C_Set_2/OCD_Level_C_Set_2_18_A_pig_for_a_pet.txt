A Pig for a Pet.

Don't Get a Pig.
If you want a pet, don't get a pig.
It's hard to hug a pet so big.

A dog is a better pet for you.
A dog is playful, loyal, and true.
A dog is your friend. She can run and be frisky.
But a pig for a pet is a little bit risky.

A pig will spoil your outdoor fun.
He will not jump. He will not run.

Can you imagine a pig at the park?
The pets at the park all meow or else bark!

Your pet will oink. He will grunt and squeal.
Kids will point and ask, "What's the deal?"
You will say, "This pig is my pet."
Their dogs will growl. Their cats will fret.

A pig as your pet will bring trouble to you.
You will ask your friends, "What should I do?"

He will slosh in mud. He will oink a lot.
You will wonder, "What kind of pet have I got?"

Don't get a pig if you want a pet.
A pig as a pet is not a good bet.
Don't get a pig! Instead get a dog.
Or else get a bird, a fish, or a frog.

Get a Cat or Dog!
Or get a furry and cute little cat!
No pet friend is cuter than that!
A cat is coy, dainty, and sweet.
A cat tiptoes lightly on soft, little feet.

You can pet a cat on her soft head.
It can even sleep right in your bed.
A pig for a pet will destroy that bed!
He will shatter the frame and drip slop on the spread.

You will not enjoy a pig for a pet.
At least not now. At least not yet.

Please! Wait until you get a farm!
Then your pet pig will do no harm.
A pig is delightful when you live on a farm!
And you will exclaim, "My pet pig has charm!"

If you want a pet (at least for now)
try a cat or a dog ...

or perhaps a cow!
