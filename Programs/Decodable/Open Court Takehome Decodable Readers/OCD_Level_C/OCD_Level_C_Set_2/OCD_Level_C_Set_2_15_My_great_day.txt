My Great Day.

The Trip.
I took a ride.
I took a look.

I saw woodlands and a brook.
I saw a sandy, sandy beach.

My only food, a sweet, sweet peach.

I rode my bike; it was a thrill!
I rode my bike down a big hill.
I rode past where a tall tree stood.
I rode so fast; it felt so good.

I rode to see the sun shine bright.
I rode and rode with all my might.
I rode my bike, and best of all,
I rode to where the acorns fall.

I shook the branch and down they came.
The acorns fell; they fell like rain.
I filled my pocket with a bunch,
and then I headed home for lunch.

Going Home.
Again I rode with all my might.
I rode and still the sun shone bright.
I rode so fast; I rode so free.
I rode back past the big old tree.

Then, as I pedaled up the hill,
I feared that I might take a spill.
So, at the light I had to stop
and walk my bike up to the top.

I stopped to take a little rest.
Then, from a pocket in my vest,
I pulled the very sweet, sweet peach.
I ate it sitting on the beach.

After finishing my snack,
the time had come for going back.
Through brook and woodlands, riding hard,
I pedaled back into the yard.

As I was walking through the door,
the acorns fell out on the floor.
I placed them neatly on a plate.
I said out loud, "My day was GREAT!"

Mama took a look at me
and sat me down upon her knee.
She gave me something good to eat
and then three acorns, for a treat.

Mama reached into a nook.
She then took out a favorite book.
I drifted off as she read on,
until the light was nearly gone.

She said, "You need to take a nap!"
And so I curled up in her lap.
