Beach Peach.

Peach.
"Today is the best day I've ever seen!" said
Pete. He skipped past a peach tree. Then he
stopped.
"Help! Help me, please!"
Who was asking for help?

"I'm here!" said a peach. "I seem to have
dropped from the tree. Can you help me?"
Pete looked at the tree. "I'm scared of
being up in trees," said Pete.

"Oh," said the peach sadly. "What will I do?" The
peach began to weep.
"Can you play catch? Can you run on the beach?
Can you make things with mud?" asked Pete.
"I can!" said the peach.
"Then come with me!" said Pete.

Pete and Peach had lots of fun.
They played catch.
They made heaps of mud shapes.
When it rained, they painted ships at sea.

Some days they would have a seat under a tree.
There they would speak of the sea and the beach.
They would hear birds peep and tweet.

Beach.
One day, Mom said, "Let's go to the beach!"
Pete and Peach played in the sand.
They swam in the waves.

Then Mom said, "Let's take a rest!"
"Stay on the sheet," Pete said. "It is easy for a
wave to sweep you off the beach."
Then Pete went to sleep, but Peach did not.
He gazed at the sea.
"I will get Pete a special treat," said Peach
to himself.

Peach went on the sandy beach. He looked
at seashells until he saw one he liked. It was
a pretty, pale green. It would make the
perfect gift for Pete.

Pete picked up the seashell.
Then a wave picked up Peach!

Pete saw that Peach was gone.
"Peach! Peach!" yelled Pete. "Where can he be?"
"Here I am! I am on this piece of rock!" said Peach.

Peach was not in reach!
"Jump to me!" said Pete.
"Will you catch me?" asked Peach.
"I will catch you!" said Pete. "Believe me."
Peach leaped into the hands of Pete.

"You must not leave when I ask you to stay,"
said Pete.
"I will not leave," said Peach. "But I needed a gift
for you. It was a pretty, green seashell. But I lost it."
"That's okay," said Pete. "I'm just glad that you are safe."

Later, Peach said to Pete, "Thank you for
saving me. What can I do for you?
"You play catch. You run on the beach. You
make things with mud," said Pete. "You are my
pal, and that is okay with me."

"You are my pal, too," said Peach.
And then they went to sleep.
