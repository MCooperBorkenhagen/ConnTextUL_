Badger and the Drum.

Hungry Badger.
Badger, hungry and grumbling, trudged back
to his den. He had trudged since sun-up, and now
it had started to get dark.

Badger stopped to rest. 

"This is absurd," blurted Badger. "I cannot take this
drudging and trudging. I must have fun. I must have
entertainment! I must have dinner in this belly!"

Badger imagined apples and apricots and
nuts and figs dangling on all the branches.
But that just got him hungrier.

It was fall, and not much hung on
the branches.

Badger started singing. He sang all the songs
he knew. Then he sang songs he didn't know
at all. But singing made him sad.

And that made him think of his hunger.

Then Badger jumped.
RAT-TAT-TAT, BAM-BAM, RAT-TAT-TAT.
Badger darted a look here and there, and
then he spotted this thing hanging in a tree.

A branch - jerking in the wind - kept on
thwacking at the hanging thing, setting off a
RAT-TAT-TAT, RAT-TAT-TAT! When the hanging
thing hit the tree trunk, it went BAM-BAM!

Badgers are not smart. And there aren't a lot
of badgers that know what a drum is.

When Badger spotted the thing, he thought that it
was like an apple. After all, it was hanging in a tree,
it had a skin, and it looked yummy.

The RAT-TAT-TAT dazzled Badger. He started
snapping his fingers and clapping his hands.
Then he got up and kicked his legs and twirled
in circles. He perked up and, in fact, felt glad.

But then Badger's belly went RUMBLE
GRUMBLE. Badger decided to have the odd
hanging thing as his dinner.

Badger attacked the drum and ripped its skin
off. But - as one may expect - there was not one
thing in it. Badger was still hungry, and now the
thing was ripped.
Know what a thing is first. Then judge what to do with it.
