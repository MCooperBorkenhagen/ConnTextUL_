June and the Duke.

In this small village, 
there lived a Duke named James.  

Duke James ruled. 
But Duke James was sad. 
Who can make me smile? 
asked Duke James.  

I can! yelled a mule named Pete.  
I will use my lips.  
I will sing a tune.  

Pete sang.  
Pete joked.  
Pete smiled.  But Duke James was not amused.  
Who can make me smile! 
asked Duke James.  

I can! called Eve Giraffe.  
I will use this violin.  
I will make music for you.  

Eve Giraffe made music on her violin.  
Eve Giraffe danced.  
Eve Giraffe smiled.  
But Duke James still did not smile.  
Who can make me smile? 
asked Duke James.  

I can! yelled Bev, a giant.  
I will use a flute.  
I will create a pretty tune.  
I will tell jokes.  

Bev created a nice tune on her flute.  
Bev told many jokes.  
Bev smiled, 
but Duke James did not smile.  
Can someone here 
make me smile? asked Duke James.  

Excuse me, Sir Duke.  
Duke James expected a mule 
or a giraffe or a giant.  
But it was a little girl.  

I am called June.  I can make you 
smile, stated June.  
That is a nice name, said Duke James, 
but what can you do?  

June, can you sing a tune?  
No, sir, spoke June.  
Can you make music on a violin or 
a flute?  
No, sir, spoke June.  
Can you dance 
or tell jokes? asked Duke James.  
No, sir, stated June.  

Then what can you do, June? 
asked Duke James.  
I can be your friend, said June.  
Duke James said nothing.  
Then Duke James smiled.  

It was a huge smile! 

June and Duke James and a mule 
and a giraffe and a giant smiled 
and became good friends.
