The Opossum at Night.
 
Mrs. Opossum does not like the light.  
It is too bright. She sees better at night. 

When it is night, she wakes.  
She hunts for insects to feed her babies.

A dog frightens the opossum.  
The opossum freezes.  She stays still 
and plays dead. 
She plays opossum. 

Night is over.  It begins to get light.  

The opossum returns to her tree.  
Her babies are waiting.
