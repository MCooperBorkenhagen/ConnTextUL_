The King of Purple.

King Purple liked purple.  
His clothes were purple.  His purple bed 
had purple quilts.  His rugs were purple.  
His pets were purple, also.

In his beautiful garden King Purple 
walked and checked on his purple things.  
Purple buds, little purple yams, big purple 
squash, and a purple kumquat filled 
his garden.

King Purple went hunting on his 
purple yak.  
He hunted purple birds, purple 
squirrels, and a purple bear.

In his backyard King Purple had purple 
plums, purple bananas, and purple 
lemons.  King Purple picked a special 
purple berry for lunch! 

In King's Purple's pond were purple fish 
and purple frogs.  Quacking purple ducks 
and squirming purple squids swam in his
pond.

Everything in King Purple's Kingdom, 
from big too small, was purple.  
Purple, purple, purple!

"There is too much purple.  
I am sick of just purple," said King 
Purple.
"Look up at that!" King Purple said 
to his men.  
"That is not purple.  I will get some 
things that are black."

King Purple went to a shop that had many 
black things.

They had black ink for pens and stamps.  
King Purple got a black quill pen for a 
quarter.  
King Purple put on a black mask.  
Everyone laughed at him!  
King Purple went back with his black things.  
He went to bed and slept.

When King Purple got up, he said, 
"Look up!  What is that?  That is not black. 
That is not purple.  I like that a lot.  
I wish for things that are pink."

King Purple wet to the market.  
He got some yarn and an umbrella.  
King Purple got fun, fat pants!  
All were pink!

The sun was setting when King 
Purple got back.
"Look up!" said King Purple.  
King Purple squinted at the sun.  
That is not purple.  
That is not black.  That is not pink.  
I wish for things that are red."

The next morning, King Purple called to 
his helpers again, 
"I wish to be with things that are red!  
Let's see red hills and red plants.  
Somewhere on this trip we will see 
pretty red birds."

In dark red hills King Purple stopped 
at an art show.  On this trip he got a 
red thing with springs.  It went "zing."
A red harp had strings that went "ping."  
He hit a red bell that went "ding dong."

The men asked King Purple, 
"Which one is best for you?  
We do not understand.  
First you loved purple, then black.  
Next you wanted pink, then red." 
An odd thing happened next.  
"Perhaps this is best," said King Purple, 
"after all."
Everyone chuckled and said, "Hurray!"
