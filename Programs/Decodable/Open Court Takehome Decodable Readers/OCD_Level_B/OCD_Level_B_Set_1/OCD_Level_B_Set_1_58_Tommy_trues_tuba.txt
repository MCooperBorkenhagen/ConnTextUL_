Tommy True's Tuba.
 
Tommy True blew a few notes on this tuba.  
That is hurting my ears, said Sammy 
True.  Can you play your tuba somewhere 
else?  I'm trying to glue my plane. 
Okay, Tommy said.  He left the kitchen.
 
Tommy True went to his mom's study.  
He licked his lips and blew one note.  
It is too much racket, said his mom.  
And these bills are due.  Can you blow 
that tuba elsewhere?
Okay, said Tommy.  He left the study.
 
Tommy True entered the den.  He 
blew a few notes.
Must you blow that in here? asked his 
dad.  I have to open this flue, or the 
smoke cannot get through. Could you 
take your tuba outside?
Okay, said Tommy.  He grew a little 
grumpy, but he left.
 
Tommy went into his yard where he 
blew a note or two.  But his sister was 
there doing a puzzle.  
I cannot solve a single clue with that 
huge blast! she grumbled.
Tommy almost threw a fit.  Then he saw 
clothes drying on a line.
 
Tommy took all the clothes from the line, 
and he stuffed them in his tuba.
It will not make a racket now, he claimed.
 
Tommy True blew and blew -- until he 
turned blue.  And not a peep was heard.
