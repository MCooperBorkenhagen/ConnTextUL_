The King Who Was Late.
 
The Message.
King Ray was late.  
My wife will be mad 
if I make her wait, he said.  
I must tell her that I will be late.
 
So King Ray told his Page:  
Please tell Queen Fay that I may not 
be on time for dinner tonight.
 
His Page told a Squire:  
Tell Queen Fay that King Ray may put 
on a bright leaf for dinner tonight.
 
The Squire told Lord Jay:  
Tell Queen Fay that King Ray may sail 
a fancy kite before dinner this night.
 
Lord Jay told a Mayor:  
Tell Queen Fay that King Ray may have 
berries on ice for dinner this night.
 
The Mayor told a Duchess:  
Tell Queen Fay that King Ray may need 
some nice rice for dinner this night.
 
The Answer.
The Duchess told a Maid:  
Tell Queen Fay that King Ray may 
invite five mice for dinner this night.
 
The Maid told Prince Henry:  
Tell Queen Fay that 
King Ray might fight thieves twice 
before dinner this night.
 
Prince Henry told Princess Paige:  
Tell Queen Fay that King Ray may 
add the right spice and make a fine 
dinner this night.
 
Princess Paige told Queen Fay:  
King Ray may not be on time to dine tonight.
 
And Queen Fay answered:  
You need not tell me that!  
King Ray is never on time to dine!
