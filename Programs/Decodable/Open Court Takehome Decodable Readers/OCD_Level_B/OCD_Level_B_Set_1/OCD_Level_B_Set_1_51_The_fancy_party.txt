The Fancy Party.

Nellie and Willy like to have fancy 
parties. They invite Nellie's baby dolls 
and teddies.  Today Willy's puppies 
are invited, too.  

Nellie sets up a table in her yard.  
Willy puts napkins and plates 
on the table.  
Willy's puppies help.  

Nellie makes funny party hats.  
Willy tapes ribbons onto each hat.  
Willy's puppies help.  

Nellie has red berries from her garden.  
Willy puts a big berry on every plate.  
Willy's puppies help.  

Nellie gets out candy and ice cream.  Willy 
begins to put ice cream on each plate.  
No more help, please! Nellie tells 
Willy's puppies.  

The fancy party is over.  
Nellie's babies and teddies are muddy.  
The candy is dirty, and party hats are torn.  
Happy puppies lap up melted ice cream.  
Thanks for the help, Willy tells his 
puppies.
