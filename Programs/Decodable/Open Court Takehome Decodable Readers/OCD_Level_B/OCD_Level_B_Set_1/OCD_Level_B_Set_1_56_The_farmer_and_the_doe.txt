The Farmer and the Doe.
 
Farmer Joe checks his crops.  
They are ripe!  
It is time to pick tomatoes!  
Farmer Joe gets his hoe.
 
A doe gets his tomatoes first.  
The doe likes Farmer Joe's tomatoes.  
But Farmer Joe does not like this doe.  
This doe is his foe, not his friend.
 
The doe spots Farmer Joe.  Oh, no!  
She runs away with some tomatoes!  
Farmer Joe runs after her.  
He waves his hoe.
 
He stubs his toe!  
That doe brings woe to Farmer Joe.  
There goes that doe!  
Farmer Joe did not want that doe 
to eat his tomatoes!
 
Farmer Joe stops.  
He does not see a doe, 
but he sees his tomatoes.  
Where is that doe?
 
This doe is not a foe!  
Farmer Joe drops his hoe.  
He cannot be mad at this doe.  
He and the doe can both have 
tomatoes now.
