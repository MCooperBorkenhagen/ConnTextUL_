A Clown Comes to Town.

The Browns were not outside that day. 
Each person sat by a TV.  
Sunny today, then showers! A man 
on TV said.  
Pow, pow! To the tower, men! said the 
other box.  
Mom, Dad, and Howie wore frowns.  
No one had much to say.  

Howie shut down his game.  
What is on now? he asked his dad.  
A woman in a gown has 
a gold crown on her head.  She is 
taking a bow.  
Howie made a face.  

This paper says that Chowder 
the Clown is now at Town Hall!  
How about it?  Shall we go?  asked Mom.  
A clown named Chowder? asked Dad 
with a scowl on his brow.  
I'm too old for clowns, Mom!  fussed Howie.  
I'm not! said Mom.  
And that was that.  The Browns were off!

Everyone in town was there. 
Town Hall was hot and crowded.  
Mom and Dad met friends and talked.  
Howie was allowed to eat 
whatever he liked.  

Then Chowder the Clown came on stage
-- and WOW! He was great!  
We could not guess how he did his tricks.  
He made a dog meow and a cat bow-wow!  
He changed a fish into a owl!  
He went Poof! And a ball became 
powder.  

At the end of his show Chowder tossed 
flowers from his hat.  The crowd clapped and 
cheered. Then Chowder ran off the stage.  
The Browns sang silly songs all the way 
home.  They howled with laughter.  When the 
Browns got home, Howie said, 
I want to see Chowder the Clown again 
when he returns to town.
