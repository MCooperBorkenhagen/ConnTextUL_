The Cold Troll.

Jake Troll's old home felt cold.  
It was so cold that ice formed on his nose.  
It was so cold that his stove froze.

Jake Troll poked his broken stove with 
a stick.  
This is no joke, Jake Troll said.  
This cold is too much.  I have one last 
hope.  I will go drop a note for Mole.

Mole had a nice snug hold.  
Cold Jake Troll left a note.  
He slipped the note into Mole's hole.

HELLO, MOLE.  
HELP!  I AM SO COLD!  
MY STOVE HAS FROZEN.  ICE 
IS ON MY NOSE!  
JAKE 
TROLL.

Mole read Jake Troll's note.  
Do not mope, Troll, Mole scolded.  
Take home this robe.

Jake Troll went home and put on his robe.  
For once, Jake Troll had no ice on his nose.  
I am not cold! yelled Jake Troll.  
Thank you, Mole!
