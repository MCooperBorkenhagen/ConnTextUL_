The Snow Game.

More Snow.
"Oh, no," moaned Joe. "New snow!"
"More snow?" cried Joan.
"No! Not more snow!"

"Snow is on the sidewalks.
Snow is on the roads.
Snow is everywhere!" said Joe.

"I'm tired of winter and being cold.
And I'm tired of deep snow!"
moaned Joan.

"Why? We could make a snowman
or go sledding," said Joe.
"I'm tired of snowmen and
sledding," muttered Joan.
"I just want it to be summer."

"Okay," Joe told Joan. "Then
we will make summer come.
We will go to the beach.
Get your coat. Here we go."

At the Beach.
"Here we are at the coast.
See the hot sun in the sky?
Do you like it?" asked Joe.
"This is not the coast," argued Joan.
"It's a yard full of white snow!"

"The grass has grown too high.
We can't see the blue water.
Help me mow a path," said Joe.
"We are mowing?" asked Joan.

"This sand is so hot.
Wiggle your toes in it.
We'll make a sand castle," said Joe.
"A sand castle?" asked Joan.

"Here, I'll show you," said Joe.
"Take this pail and three pieces of coal."
"It still looks like a snowman," said Joan.

"Okay, then follow me.
We will go on a boat!
Here are some oars," said Joe.
"Joe, you can't row in snow!" snickered Joan.

"Okay, then we'll just float.
We'll let the wind blow us.
I'll just push us off," said Joe.
"Blow us? Without a sail?" asked Joan.

"Whoa!"

"I am soaked," grumbled Joan.
"It's time to go back to winter.
I need a cup of hot cocoa!"
