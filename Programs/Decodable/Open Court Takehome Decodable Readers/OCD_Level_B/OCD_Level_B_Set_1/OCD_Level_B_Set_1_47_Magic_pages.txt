Magic Pages.

When I turn magic pages, 
I can take a trip.

I can travel to far lands and 
hunt for gems.

I can swim with sharks.  
I can jump on the back of a giant whale.

I can hunt for large shells 
that whisper in my ear.  

I can watch tan camels run 
or huge giraffes standing in the sun.

Turn a page, and a trip is finished.  
I am back home in my little bed!
