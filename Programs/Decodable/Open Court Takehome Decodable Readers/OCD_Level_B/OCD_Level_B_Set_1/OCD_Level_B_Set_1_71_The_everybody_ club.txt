The Everybody Club.

The Girls Club.
Abby and Rose went over 
to Nancy's yard to play.

Hurry up! called Nancy. 
We can play in my tree house!

Wow! What a neat place! said Abby. 
Let's make a club! said Rose. 
We can call it the Three Girls Club.

Rose got out paints and paper. 
Abby painted Three Girls Club 
and three faces on the paper.

Hi! called Holly. Can I climb up? 
Nancy said, We have a club. 
It's called Three Girls Club. 
You would make four.
Holly looked down. She hung her head.

Well, said Nancy, 
how about just Girls Club? 
Abby crossed out Three 
and painted a face. 
Now we are the Girls Club! 
shouted Rose.

The Everybody Club.
Hi! Called David. Can I climb up? 
Well, said Rose, this is a club for 
girls, and you aren't a girl. 
David frowned. He kicked the dirt.

Well, said Nancy, 
how about the First Grade Club? 
Abby crossed out Girls and painted 
First Grade. Then she painted a fifth 
face. 
Now we are the First Grade Club! 
said Rose.

Hi! called Nancy's big brother, Tom. 
Can I climb up? 
Well, said Nancy, this is 
the First Grade Club, 
and you aren't in first grade. 
Tom scowled.

Well, said Holly, 
how about the All Grades Club?
Abby crossed out First, 
added an s, and painted All. 
Then she painted a sixth face. 
Now we are the All Grades Club! 
chuckled Rose.

Hi! called Abby's little sister. 
Can I come up?
Well, said Abby, we have a club. 
It's called the All Grades Club, 
and you aren't even in kindergarten!

It's getting crowded! said Rose. 
How about just calling it 
the Everybody Club? 
Abby crossed out All Grades 
and painted Everybody. 
Then she painted lots of faces.

Welcome to the Everybody Club! 
called Rose.
