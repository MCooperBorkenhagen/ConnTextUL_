Grab a Star.

"Mom, are stars far off?" asked Max.
"Yes, Max," said Mom.  
"Stars are far, far away."

"Mom, can I grab stars for fun?"
 asked Max.  
"Hmmm ... grab stars for fun ...," 
said Mom.

"Sit here, Max," added Mom.  
"You can catch stars for fun."

Max mumbled, "Stars are so far.  
I can't have stars."

"Max," called Mom. 
"This is a star you can catch!"

"I can catch stars!" said Max.  
"Mom, you are smart!"
