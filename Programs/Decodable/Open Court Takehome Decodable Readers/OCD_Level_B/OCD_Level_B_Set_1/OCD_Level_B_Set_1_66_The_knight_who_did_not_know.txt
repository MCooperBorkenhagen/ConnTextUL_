The Knight Who Did Not Know.

Long ago, King Knox had a knight that 
lived with him.  
King Knox asked his knight to do many 
things.  
Can you tie this knot? asked King Knox.  
I don't know how, replied his knight.

Can you sharpen this knife?
asked King Knox.
I don't know how, replied his knight,
but this knife would be good to
butter my roll.

Can you knit some socks for me? 
asked King Knox.
No, I don't know how, replied his 
knight, but this wool would make 
a nice, soft bed.

King Knox was getting mad.  
He knocked on the knight's door.  
When I ask you to do something, 
you say you don't know how.  
What do you know?

His knight got down on his knees.  
I know one thing, he replied.  
I don't want to be a knight any more!

King Knox's knight packed a knapsack.  
He left and lived on a farm.  
He was happy from that day on.
