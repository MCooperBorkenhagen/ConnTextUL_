Sailor Paul and the Crabs.

Sailor Paul liked to catch crabs that crawl 
in the sea.  Paul went out in his yawl.  
It was a small fishing boat named Awful 
Annie.  He caught crabs in big nets and 
then hauled in his catch.  But he never 
trapped a single crab.

With a big yawn he set out to sea 
at dawn.  I'm going to catch a crab 
today! yelled Sailor Paul.  Soon his 
nets were full and taut, and Paul hauled 
them up on deck.

Get away, silly squid, scolded Sailor Paul.  
Don't sprawl on my yawl.  
I catch crabs, not squid.

When his nets were full again, Paul 
pulled them quickly in.  I'm fishing for 
crabs, not shark! yelled Sailor Paul.  
Get off my deck if you don't want a 
brawl!  Sailor Paul fished and fished. 
He netted ten tuna, five whales, and a 
hundred prawns.  But he did not catch 
one crab.

I'll catch some crabs if it's the last thing 
I do, said Sailor Paul.  When rain began 
falling, Sailor Paul put an awning on his deck. 
When a cold wind blew, he put on a shawl. 
The sea became wild and awful, but Paul 
would not quit.  At last, his nets were full, and 
Paul began pulling and pulling.

Perhaps I don't really want crabs 
at all, said Sailor Paul.
