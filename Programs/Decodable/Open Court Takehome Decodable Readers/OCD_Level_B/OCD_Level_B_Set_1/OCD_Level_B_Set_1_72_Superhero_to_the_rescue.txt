Superhero to the Rescue.

The Cape.
Lenny wanted to be a superhero.

Lenny put on his cape.  
Superhero to the rescue! he shouted. 
He raced downstairs.

Lenny landed on top 
of his little sister Jenny.
Ouch! shouted Jenny.  
She began crying.

Go play quietly, 
Lenny's mom told him.

Lenny and Jenny played house with 
the baby.  
Jenny grabbed the baby's doll.

Superhero is here! 
shouted Lenny.
He pushed Jenny out of the way.

Jenny and the baby 
both began crying.

Lenny to the Rescue.
Play something quieter, 
Lenny's mom told him.
Lenny went outside.

Pow! Wow! shouted Lenny.  
He raced to an oak tree.  
Lenny's cat sat on one branch.  
Meow! cried his cat.

Superhero to the rescue! 
shouted Lenny.  
He reached for a branch.

Lenny's mom found him in the tree.  
She helped him get down.  
Play safer, she said.  
They went back inside.

At naptime Lenny became bored.  
His mom had put Jenny 
and the baby down for naps.

Lenny went upstairs. 
The baby was crying.  
His bunny had fallen out of his crib.

Lenny picked up the bunny.  
He put it back in the crib.  
The baby stopped crying.  
Superhero to the rescue, 
Lenny whispered.
