Birthday Clues.

"This is what I wish for my birthday," I said.
"Tell your mom and dad, said June.
"Your birthday is soon."
"I did. I left them a note with a clue," I said.

Andrew wants 
something big
and blue for
his birthday.
"Big and blue?
What is big and blue?"
asked Andrew's dad.

"A balloon! That must be it!
He wants a big, blue balloon," said Mom.
"I must try a new clue," whispered
Andrew to himself.

It is 
made of
metal tubes.
"Maybe he wants a tube of toothpaste,"
said Dad. "Toothpaste can blue, but it is
not big."
"No, silly," chuckled Mom. "Andrew wants a
tuba for his birthday. A tuba is really big."
"But I've never seen a blue tuba," said Dad.

"Did your mom and dad get your
newest clue?
Will you get a new bike?" asked June.

"No, I think I'm getting a tube of
toothpaste or a tuba," I moaned.
"You need better clues!" June said.
"Toothpaste is a terrible birthday gift!"
