Zack the One-Man Band.

Gus and Cass sat on rocks.
ZAP!  POP!  SNAP!
"What is it?" said Cass.

"It's a red bus.  It has a man 
and a big brass band," said Gus.

The man on the red bus blasted, 
"I am Zack the One-Man Band, 
and here is my big brass band!"

BAM!  BUZZ!  BOP!
Zack's band started up.
"Zack, you are a grand band!" called Cass.

Zack huffed and puffed.  
"I must stop," he panted.

"Do not fuss," added Zack.  
"Grab tin pots!  Grab small sticks!  
Start a grand band!"
Zack and his band 
got back on his red bus.
