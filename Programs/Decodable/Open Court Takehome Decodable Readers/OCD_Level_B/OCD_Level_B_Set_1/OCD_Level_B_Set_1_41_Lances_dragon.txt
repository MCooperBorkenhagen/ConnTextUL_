Lance's Dragon.

Get up! Lance's mom yelled.  
Cedric the Dragon was here!  
Cedric has my silver bracelet and lace 
scarf! she added.  
All citizens have had enough!

That dragon is bad, stated Lance.  
Cedric must be stopped.  
Lance did not wish to face 
a dragon. But Lance was mad.  
Lance paced in a circle.  Then he raced out.

Lance walked into a cave.  It was as hot as 
a blazing sun.  There were cinders all over 
the place.  In the distance Lance could see 
Cedric up in the center of a red-hot blaze.  
Lance went up to Cedric's face and felt hot flames.
That  dragon is bad, Lance 
stammered.  I do not like this place.

Lance glanced at Cedric's ring.  It was his 
mom's bracelet!  Lance spotted the lace scarf.  
Lance grabbed for the bracelet and scarf.  
Flames licked Lance's face.  Then Lance 
spotted something else.  For a dragon, Cedric 
was too thin.  This was Lance's big chance.

Mom makes a great apple cake, 
Lance said. We love apple cake.  
But Mom cannot bake cakes unless we 
have a flame.  Can you lend us your 
flame?  You can live with us 
and help make apple cakes.

Cedric had a space in Lance's basement 
and a place at their table.  Cedric liked the 
city and its citizens. Cedric ate lots of cake.
Cedric became a fat and contented dragon.  
Cedric and Lance became friends.
