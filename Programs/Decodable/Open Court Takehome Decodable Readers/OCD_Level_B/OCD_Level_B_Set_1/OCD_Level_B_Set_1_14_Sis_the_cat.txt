Sis the Cat.

Sis and Dad. There is Sis. Sis spins and stops on the mat.
Sis can sit. Sis can nap.
Sis can hit. Sis can tap.
Sis taps the pans. Sis hits the hats.  
Dad is mad.  Scat, cat! 

Where is Sis? Sis scats.  Where is Sis?
Is Sis on the mat? Sis is not on the mat.
Is Sis in the hat? Sis is not in the hat.  
Is Sis in a tin pan? Sis is not in a tin pan.
Is Sis with Sam and Pam? No, Sis is not with Sam and Pam. 
I miss Sis.  Where is Sis?
Dad has Sis. Sis sits on him.  
Dad is not mad.  And sis is not sad.
I can sit with Sis and Dad.
