Max the Grouch.

Pat loved her brown and 
white hound named Max.  
But Max was a grouch! 

Maybe Max needs a new 
dog house, said Mom.  
But Max was still a grouch.  

Does he want a pound of 
dog bones?  asked Dad.  
Dad put a large bone on the ground.  


Max put a bone in his mouth.  
Then he spit it out and made a loud sound!  
Dog bones did not help.  
Max was still a grouch.  

How about a long walk? asked Pat.  
She and Max walked for an hour  
Now Max was a tired grouch.  

Pat went to feed Max.  
Look, Mom! Pat whispered.  
Max found a friend!  
Max and the mouse were very happy.
