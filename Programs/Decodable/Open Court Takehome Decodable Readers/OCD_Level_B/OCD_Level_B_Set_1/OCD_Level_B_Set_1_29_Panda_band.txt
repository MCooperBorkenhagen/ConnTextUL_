Panda Band.

Amanda's Sax.

Amanda Panda mops at 
Tom Cat's Jazz Club.  
She pushes a damp mop.

Amanda stops.  
"I can't stand this," Amanda sniffs.

"I am hot and a mess. 
This job must stop!"

Amanda gazes at Tom Cat and his brass sax.

"Tom Cat," Amanda grumbles, 
"you do not have to mop.  
You have a brass sax, 
a big band, and lots of fans."

Tom Cat tosses 
Amanda his brass sax.  
"Hush," he tells Amanda Panda.  
"I can fix things for you.  
Have this brass sax!"

"This brass sax?"
"Yes, this brass sax!"

"I got Tom Cat's 
brass sax!  
I can drop the damp mop and be tops!"

Amanda's Band.

"Mom!  Pop!" calls Amanda.  
"I got Tom Cat's brass sax!"

"Sax racket!" 
mumbles Mom.
"Sax racket!" 
grumbles Pop.

Zack and Max drop in.  
"Let's form a big band!" says Amanda Panda.
"Oh, no!  More 
racket!" think Mom and Pop.

Amanda Panda has Tom Cat's brass sax, 
a big band, and lots of fans. 
"You are tops!" Mom and Pop tell 
Amanda.
