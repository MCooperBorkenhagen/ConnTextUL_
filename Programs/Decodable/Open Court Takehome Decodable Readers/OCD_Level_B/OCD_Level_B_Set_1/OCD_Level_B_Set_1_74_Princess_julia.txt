Princess Julia.

Julia the Royal.
My little sister Julia thinks 
she is a princess. 
She thinks she is a real princess.  
I just call her Julie.

Julie wears fancy gowns and shoes.  
She has a silly paper crown on her head.  
She even had a crown on her head in 
bed!  I'm a princess! A real princess! 
Julie says.

I tell Julie she is wrong.  
Julie tells me that rude sisters 
should bow and beg her royal pardon.

One night Dad read us a fairy tale.  
He read The Princess and the Pea.  
In it, a queen tested a visitor.  
The visitor said she was a real princess.  
The queen put a pea in a bed.  
The visitor tried to sleep on that bed.  

The visitor could not sleep.  
She felt something hard in her bed.  
Only a real princess could have felt 
a single pea in such a bed!

That story of the princess and the pea 
gave me an idea.

The next night, I put a marble 
under my sister's mattress.  
She never felt a tickle.  
She slept like a baby all night.

The night after that, I put a bag 
of marbles, a wrench, and a toy truck 
under Julie's mattress. 
Julie never even wiggled.

The night after that, I put a bag of 
marbles, a wrench, a toy truck, her bear 
Cuddles, my old sneakers, and Julie's 
own crown under her mattress.  
Julie never even missed Cuddles!

The next day, Julie looked for her crown.  
I picked up her mattress.  
See? I shouted.  
You are not a real princess! 
Remember The Princess and the Pea?
Look under your bed!  
No real princess could sleep on all that!

Julie put on her wrinkled crown.  
That was only a fairy tale, she cried.  
A real princess can sleep 
any place, any time, 
any way she wants!  
And I am a real princess!

Then the real princess 
ordered her royal sister 
to take the marbles, the wrench, 
the toy truck, Cuddles, and 
the sneakers out from under 
her royal mattress.
