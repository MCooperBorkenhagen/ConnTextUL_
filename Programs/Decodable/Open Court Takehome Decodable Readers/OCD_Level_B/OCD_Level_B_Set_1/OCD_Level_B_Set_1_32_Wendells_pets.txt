Wendell's Pets.

Wendell had lots of pets.  
Wendell had his cat and his duck.  

Wendell had his rabbit and his lizard.  
Wendell had frogs and a tub for his bugs.

When Wendell's pets went to his class, 
his class was glad.
But Mr. Allen was not glad.

Wendell's pets hopped, sat, and wiggled.  
"Where will you put all the pets, Wendell?" 
said Mr. Allen.

"Here!" said Wendell.  
"Next to me!"
And Wendell's pets sat next to him!
