The Fox and His Box.

Rabbit and Fox sat on Fox's big box.  
"You have a big box," said Rabbit.  
"Yes!"  snapped Fox.  "It is a trap!" 

"Can it trap dogs?" said Rabbit.  
"It can trap dogs," said Fox.  

"Can it trap cats?" said Rabbit.  
"It can trap cats," said Fox.  

"Can it trap an ox?" said Rabbit.  
"It can not trap an ox," said Fox, 
"but it can trap rabbits." 

"It can trap rabbits?" said Rabbit.  
"But I am a rapid rabbit! It can not 
trap rapid rabbits!" 

"Yes," grumbled Fox, 
"and it did not trap you!"
