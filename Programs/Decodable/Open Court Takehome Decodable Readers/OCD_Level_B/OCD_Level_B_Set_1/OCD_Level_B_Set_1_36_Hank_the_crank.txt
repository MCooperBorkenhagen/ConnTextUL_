Hank the Crank. 

Hank was such a crank.  
Hank was honking and hissing 
as much as he could.  
Hank honked at Farmer Ann.  

"Hank, I think I'll see you," 
said Farmer Ann.  
Hank honked and hissed 
at Farmer Ann.  

Farmer Ann put Hank in a box 
and put it in her van.  
On her way to Mark's Market, 
she stopped at a bank.  

A robber ran out of the bank 
and jumped into Farmer Ann's van! 
Hank banged on his box and tipped it over.  
Hank honked and sprung from his box.  

Hank started banging his head on 
the robber's long leg.  
Hank flung pebbles at the robber 
and ran him up a lamp. 

Sheriff Long got the robber. 
Farmer Ann got Hank.  
Sheriff Long thanked Hank,
but the robber thanked Farmer Ann!
