Ron on the Run.

The sun is up.  Ron is on the run.

Ron mops and dusts his hut.  Ron hums as he dusts and mops.

His cup and his bun, and Ron is back on the run.

A dump truck hits mud.  Mud hits Ron.  Ron runs and runs.

Ron runs for the bus.  The bus hits mud.  Ron sits in muck.

The bus runs on, but Ron sits and does not run.
