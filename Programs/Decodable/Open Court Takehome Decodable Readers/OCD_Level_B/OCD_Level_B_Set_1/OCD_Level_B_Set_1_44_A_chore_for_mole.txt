A Chore for Mole.

Mole's Home.

Mole decided 
to make a home 
in a place by a stone.  

This place by a stone 
was a nice place for a 
little home.  

Mole had a stove 
that made his 
home warm.

Mole stoked it with 
pine twigs, but that 
was a hard chore. 

Mole wished that he didn't 
have to do this chore 
anymore.

One morning his 
stove broke, and 
when Mole awoke, 

his home in a place next to 
a stone got too cold.


Mole's Stove.
Mole's face felt like ice.  
He was cold and chilled 
to his bones.  

But Mole fixed his 
stove in his place by 
a stone.  

When Mole stokes it 
with pine twigs, it is still 
a big chore.  

But Mole does not mind.  
This chore makes his 
home warm.

Mole still lives alone 
in his nice little home 
in the place by a stone.  

And Mole is 
nice and warm.
