How the Rabbit Caught the Tiger.

The Rabbit and the Tiger.
One winter's eve, 
a mighty and hungry tiger 
trapped a tiny rabbit.  

Do not eat me! cried Rabbit.  
I am too small to make a good meal.  
If you let me go, I will show you 
how to catch all the fish you can eat.  

Tiger was greedy.  
His hunger was bigger than his brain.  
Show me now, or I will eat you, 
Rabbit! he roared.  
Then he let Rabbit go.  

Rabbit led Tiger down to a river.  
Rabbit told Tiger, Put your tail in 
the water.  

Now wait all night.  
Fish will grab onto your tail.  
Soon your tail will grow heavy.  
Then you can pull it out 
and eat all the fish!

I'll stay close by, whispered Rabbit.  
I will let you know when 
you have caught plenty of fish.  
Rabbit climbed up the riverbank, 
sat down and watched Tiger.  

Tiger put his tail into the river.  
He waited and waited.  
It grew cold and dark.  

The Rabbit's Trick.
Is your tail getting heavy? 
called Rabbit.  
Oh yes! replied Tiger.  
I must be catching lots of fish!  
Should I pull my tail out now?

Oh, no! cried Rabbit.  
If you wait until morning, 
you will have more fish to eat.  

The greedy tiger waited longer.  
It grew colder and colder.  
His tail grew heavier.  

Finally the sun came up. 
Tiger's tail felt quite heavy.  
It is time! called Tiger.  
I am pulling my fish out now!  

Tiger pulled and pulled, 
but his tail did not come out.  
It was frozen in solid ice!  
I'm going to get you Rabbit! 
roared Tiger.  
But he could not budge at all.  

Rabbit giggled and scampered away.  
He had tricked a mighty tiger.
