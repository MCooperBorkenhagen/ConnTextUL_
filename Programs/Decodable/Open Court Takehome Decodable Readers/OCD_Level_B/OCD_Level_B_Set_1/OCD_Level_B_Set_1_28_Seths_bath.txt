Seth's Bath.

Seth stepped into his bathtub.  
"Must get to the ship!"

"Cast off!" called Seth.  
"All hands on deck!"

"Rocks in the water!  
Man the ship's masts!"

"The ship has thumped and hit big rocks.  
Get the rafts!"

"Thick fog! 
Abandon ship!"

"All finished, Seth?" said Dad.
"Yes, Dad," said Seth.  "All finished!"
