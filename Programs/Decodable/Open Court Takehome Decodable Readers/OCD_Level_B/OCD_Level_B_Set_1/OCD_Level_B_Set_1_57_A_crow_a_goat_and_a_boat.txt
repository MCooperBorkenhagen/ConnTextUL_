A Crow, a Goat, and a Boat.
 
A crow and a goat sailed in a boat.  
Their goal was the shore. 
A crow and a goat hoped to see a 
toad and a boar.
 
I want to go fast, not slow! said Goat. 
We shall soar in this boat! 
boasted Crow.
 
Oh, let strong winds blow! 
bellowed Goat to Crow.  
Here we go!  Here we go!
 
But the wind did not blow, and 
the boat did not go. 
It did not go fast, and it did not go slow.
 
This is not a great boat, 
mumbled Crow with a moan.  
All it does is just float, 
grumbled Goat with a groan.
 
Crow and goat, that boat has no sail!  
Grab both oars! 
yelled Boar from the shore.  
Oh, no, groaned goat, 
I think we MUST row!
