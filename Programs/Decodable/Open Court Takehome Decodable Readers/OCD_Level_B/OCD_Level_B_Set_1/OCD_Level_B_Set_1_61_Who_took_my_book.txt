Who Took My Book?

Bunny got home from school.  
He shook out his backpack.  
Where is my joke book? He asked.

Oh, no!  Where is your joke book? 
asked Mom. I will help you look for it.

Mom and Bunny took a walk.  
They hoped to find Bunny's book. 
Mom and Bunny looked by the 
babbling brook.
No book!

I heard a laugh.
Should we look here? Mom asked.  
Mom and Bunny looked behind a wood pile.

This book makes me laugh. 
It is funny! said Bird.  
This joke book was on the path home 
from school.  But I will give it back.

Bunny took his joke book and told Bird, 
Thank you for returning my joke book.  
I will read it today.
You are a good friend, Bunny added.
