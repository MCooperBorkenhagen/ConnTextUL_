Patch Gets the Ball.

Lil, Midge, and Chuck met 
at Chestnut Ridge Ball Park.
Midge pitched the ball, 
and Lil hit it.
Midge ran after the ball 
and tossed it to Chuck.

"Let's switch," said Chuck.  
Chuck was pitcher, 
Midge was hitter, 
and Lil was catcher.
Midge hit the pitched ball. 
"I'll catch it!" called Chuck.

But the ball went past Chuck, 
past tall grass, past bushes, 
and landed in a ditch.

"Patch!" Midge called for her dog.
"Fetch the ball, Patch!"

Patch ran past tall grass.
He ran past bushes
and into the ditch.
Patch fetched the ball.

"Let's do this.  
Chuck can be hitter.  
I will be pitcher.  
Lil can be catcher, 
and Patch can be the fetcher!"
