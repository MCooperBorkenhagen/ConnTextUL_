Quarter Pond.

Lots of animals swim 
in Quarter Pond.  

Squads of ducks quack 
and quack.  
Ducks do not quit and quack 
until dark.  

Fish squirt liquid at 
bugs to catch them. 
This bug is quick, 
but this fish is quicker.  

Kids plan a picnic.  
Mom puts her quilt 
on the grass.  

Kids squat by Quarter Pond, but 
cannot catch the quick fish.  

Kids can swim in 
Quarter Pond, too.
