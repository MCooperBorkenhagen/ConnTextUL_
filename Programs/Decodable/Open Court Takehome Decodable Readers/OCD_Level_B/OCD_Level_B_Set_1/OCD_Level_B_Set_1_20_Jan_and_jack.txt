Jan and Jack.

Jan packed Jack's snack.  Jan put his snack in a jug.

Jan tossed the jug in Jack's backpack. Jan jogged up hills. She jogged in grass and mud.

Jan hopped a big hedge and jumped up on a bridge.

Jack sat on the bridge.   Jack napped.

Jan tapped and nudged Jack.  "Jan, I had to sit and nap," said Jack.

"Jan, I am glad for snacks and a nap."
Jack sat and had his snacks.
