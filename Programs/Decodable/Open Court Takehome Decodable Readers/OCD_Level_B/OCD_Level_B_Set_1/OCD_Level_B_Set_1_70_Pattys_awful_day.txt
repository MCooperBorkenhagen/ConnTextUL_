Patty's Awful Day.

The New School.
We moved to a new house.  
I had to go to a new school.  
I just knew it was going to be awful.  
I can't go, I said.  I can't find 
my best shirt. 
That's silly, said Dad.  Here's a shirt.  
Now hurry, or you will be late.

This is Patty, Miss Shaw told her class.  
She is new.  Let's make her feel at home.
I didn't feel at home.  
Everything was wrong.  I felt awful.  
I missed my old school.

See my cartoon lunch box, Patty.  
Cartoons are cool, stated Sandy.
My lunch box has whales. 
All my old friends had animal lunch boxes.

Phil traded his ham 
sandwich for Laura's tuna.
Beth traded her cheese sandwich 
for Troy's carrots.
I had peanut butter.  No one wanted 
to trade.  
It was an awful lunch!


A New Friend.
Even recess was awful! 
I was the last one picked to join the team.  
Just when it was my turn, the bell rang.  
I didn't get to show them what a good 
player I am.

Miss Shaw told us to draw.  
I drew my old school and my friends.  
All my crayons broke.

I keep my crayons sharp, Sandy told Patty.  
I enjoy neat drawings.
I felt awful.  I wanted to crawl home.

I didn't have anything for Show and Tell.
My coin collection and a hat Mom 
helped me knit were still packed in boxes 
at home.  
Everyone had neat things.  
Sandy had a new camera.  
She took our photo.

Then Miss Shaw asked me to tell 
about my old school. 
I showed them my drawing.  
I told the class about my friends.

This is my old class, I explained.  
We played kickball at recess.  
We were the champions.  
We had Show and tell, too.  
I miss my old friends and my teacher.
I felt awful.

I know how you feel, said Fran.  
I came here last month.  
It is fun now.  
You will make new friends.  
I'll be your first.

Fran and I walked home.  
We talked about our old schools.  
I had a new friend.  
That first day was not so awful after all.
