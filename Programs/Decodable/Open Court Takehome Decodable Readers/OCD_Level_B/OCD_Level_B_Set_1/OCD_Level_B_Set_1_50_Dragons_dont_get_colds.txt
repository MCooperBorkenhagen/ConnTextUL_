Dragons Don't Get Colds.

Dee the dragon felt terrible.  
I feel weak, grumbled Dee. 
My nose hurts, and I can't breathe.  
I can't speak.  I just creak.  

Dee's dad felt her cheeks.  
You feel hot, he said.  
You must have a fever and a cold.  

Dragons don't get colds, creaked Dee.  
Dragons breathe hot flames.  

Can you breathe flames? asked Dad.  
No, creaked Dee.  
Dad made a pot of tea.  
This tea's heat will help you breathe, he said.  

Dragons don't like tea, created Dee.  
Sip it, said Dad.  We will see.  
Steam tickled Dee's nose.  
Dragons don't ... AH! ...get ...
AH! ... colds! ... ACHOOOO!  
Dee Sneezed a big sneeze.  

Oh! I can breathe! said Dee.  
I feel so much better!  
I am glad, Dad said with a smile, 
since dragons don't get colds.
