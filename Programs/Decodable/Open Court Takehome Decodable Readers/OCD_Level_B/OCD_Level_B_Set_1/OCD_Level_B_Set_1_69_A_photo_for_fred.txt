A Photo for Fred.

Phil got a pet puppy.  He named 
his puppy Ralph.  Phil wanted his 
friend Fred to see Ralph.  Phil planned 
on sending Fred a photo of Ralph.

Phil took Ralph to a photo shop.  
He asked for a photo shot.  
Ralph did not sit still. He barked and 
wagged and zigged and zagged.

Ralph's photo was a blur.  
Phooey! muttered Phil.  This is a 
phony photo of my pet pup. 
Ralph looks like a funny pheasant!

I will take his photo! said Phil.  
He took Ralph home.  Phil's pup barked, 
wagged, zigged, and zagged.  
He yipped, yapped, and romped.

Phooey! grumbled Phil.  No photo for 
Fred!  My pup is in a yip, yap, zig zag stage!  
A photo is not the best way to see him!

Phil phoned Fred.  Please come to my 
place! he said.  I have a yip yap, zig 
zag surprise for you!  And it barks!
