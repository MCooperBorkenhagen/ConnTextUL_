Why, Bly?
 
Bly is an ostrich. She has a small head.  
She likes to stick her head in dry sand.  
Most animals feel that Bly is an odd bird.
 
Bly, why do you stick your head 
in dry sand? cries Snake.  
Why not lie in the hot sun like me?
I do not like to lie in the hot sun, Bly replies.  
I like myself just the way I am.
 
Bly, why do you stick your head 
in dry sand? cries Chimp.  
Why not climb a tree like me? 
I do not want to climb trees, Bly replies.  
I like myself the way I am.
 
Bly, why do you stick your head 
in dry sand? cries Eagle.  
Why not fly in the sky like me?
I can't fly.  I am too big, replies Bly.  
I like myself just the way I am.
 
Bly, why do you stick your head 
in dry sand? cries a child.  
Are you shy? 
I am not shy, Bly replies.
 
It is hot and dry out here, Bly says.  
I feel better with my head stuck in the sand. 
I will stay just the way I am.
