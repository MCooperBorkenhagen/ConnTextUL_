Jen's Pen.

Ted has his hen in a pen.  
Ted's hen is Jen.  
Jen's pen is a mess.

Ted promises to mend Jen's pen.

"I'm fed up!" Jen sniffs.  
"Ted said he would mend my pen, 
but Ted did not mend it."  

"Jen is upset and is on the move!" 
snort the pigs as Jen runs past.

Jen darts on top of the pen.  
Jen trips and drops in a bucket. 
"Jen is stuck and can't get up!" 
laugh the horses.

Ted pulls her out.  
Ted pets Jen and feeds her bread.  
"I will mend Jen's pen!" Ted says.  
And Ted does mend Jen's pen.
