Cupid the Mule.

Cupid is a cute mule.  
Cupid lives in a forest 
close to the Maze River.

Cupid likes the forest and 
the Maze River.  
But Cupid likes music the most.

Alfonso is a trader.  
He cuts branches 
and trades them at the river.  
After Alfonso cuts big branches, 
he puts them on Cupid's back.  

Cupid does not like branches on his back.  
Cupid stands still and does not budge.

At last Alfonso gets out his flute.  
His flute makes nice music.  

Cupid does not like 
big branches on his back.
But Cupid likes Alfonso's music!
