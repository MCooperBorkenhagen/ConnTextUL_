Steve's Secret.

Steve had a secret.
He hid it in a box.

What is in that box? asked Eve.  
Is it an acorn?  Is it a stone?  
It is a secret, said Steve.  
It is for me.

What size is it? asked Eve.  Is it little?  
Is it big?  
It is little, stated Steve.  
But it is a secret.  Do not even ask.

What shape is it? she asked.  
Is it flat?  Is it tall?
It is not flat or tall, he stated.  
But it is my secret.  Let me be.

What shade is it?  Is it white?  
Is it red? asked Eve.

Here is the secret, 
said Steve with a smile.  
It is a kitten.  It is a gift.
