Our Town Garden.

Planting time.
Our town has a garden that we share.  
Our garden is in the town's park.  

We plow and rake the ground.  
We take out large sticks and stones.  
Then we plan the garden. 

In spring, flowers bloom.  
Around these flowers we plant 
seeds that will grow food.  
We plant seeds for tomatoes, 
beans, cucumbers, and peas.  

If we could look underground, 
we could see how seeds sprout.  
Sprouts drink water from the ground.  

Worms and ants dig holes that 
make the ground better for the plants.  
These holes let air into the ground.  

Sunflowers are gold and brown.  
Sunflowers tower over the fence 
in summer. 
Butterflies and bees swoop around 
the garden.

The Harvest.
Everyone visits the town square in 
summer.  
Children play all around.  
We work in the garden. 
But no dogs are allowed!  

Sometimes in June, the clouds get dark.  
We hear loud thunder.  
Then the garden gets a shower!  

We take good care of the ground 
around the plants.  
We take out the weeds.  
Plants are stronger when they are not 
crowded by weeds.  

At the end of summer, we harvest 
the food that we planted and grew.  

Our crew works for hours!  
Then we are surrounded by pounds 
and pounds of super cucumbers, 
beans, peas, and tomatoes.  

We have a picnic at the town park.  
We play tag and shout.  
We play until the sun goes down.  

When fall comes, the leaves fall.  
The frost makes our plants turn brown.  
It's time for us to take the old plants out of 
the ground.  Then we hang up bird feeders.  

In winter the garden is frozen.  
Flowers are waiting under the ground.  
Next spring, the garden will bloom 
and be new again.
