Sail Day.

Miss Fay! Miss Fay!  
Today is the day I get to sail!

Hi, Ray.  Yes, this is the day.  
But it is quite gray.  It may rain.  
We should wait and sail later.

Oh, I'm not afraid of rain.  
We can sail in a little rain!
We can sail, but we must be safe, 
explained Miss Fay. Stay here, Ray.  
I'll check the main.

A main? asked Ray.
Each sail has a name, 
Miss Fay told Ray.  This little one 
is called a jib.

A main?  A jib?  
I just want to sail, Miss Fay.

Yes, said Miss Fay.  But for sailing, 
you should stay out of the water!  
Here comes the rain, Ray.  
Grab a pail!  It's time for us to bail!
