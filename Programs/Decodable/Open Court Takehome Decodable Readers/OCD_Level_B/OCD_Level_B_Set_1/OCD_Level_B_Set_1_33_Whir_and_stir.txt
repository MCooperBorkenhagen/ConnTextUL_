Whir and Stir.

Uncle Art picked up his mixer.
"Pass the butter, Bert,"
said Uncle Art, "and let's stir in fresh 
milk."

Uncle Art put butter and milk 
in his mixer.  
WHIR!
"What is it?" wondered Bert.
"Hand me eggs, Bert," Uncle Art said, 
"and let's stir in a little salt."

Uncle Art put eggs and salt 
in his mixer.
WHIR!
"What is it?" wondered Bert.
"Pass the carrots, Bert,"
said Uncle Art. 
"We will stir in nuts, too."

Uncle Art put carrots and nuts 
in his mixer.
WHIR!
"What is it?" wondered Bert.
"Pass the pan, Bert," said Uncle Art.  
"We can put this batter in it."

"It was eggs and butter 
and nuts and carrots.  
What did it turn into, Uncle Art? 
Is it finished?"

"Have a glass of fresh milk, Bert.  
It turned into carrot bread," 
said Uncle Art.
"Carrot bread!  Hurray!"
