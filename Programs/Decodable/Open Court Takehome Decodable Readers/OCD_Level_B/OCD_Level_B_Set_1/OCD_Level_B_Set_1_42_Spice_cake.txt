Spice Cake. 

What is this?
Spice cake?
I can make a nice spice cake, too.

I'll add a shake of this, 
and a tiny pinch of that.

Next I'll add a plat of diced nuts, 
and nine chopped dates.

Then I'll mix in a slice or 
two of a nice ripe apple.  

Stir it a while.  
And then bake it ...

 ...and save a slice for me!
