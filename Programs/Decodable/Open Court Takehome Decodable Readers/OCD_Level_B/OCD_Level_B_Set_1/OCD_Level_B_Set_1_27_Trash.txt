Trash.

Mick had trash stacks:  
dented and bent tin cans, 

cut and split logs, 
two smashed beds, 

three cracked dishes, 
small bits of crashed ships, 

four fishnet strips, 
torn flag scraps, 

five old comic books, 
a crushed red drum set, 
and half a smashed sled.

Mick put his trash stack in the small shed.
