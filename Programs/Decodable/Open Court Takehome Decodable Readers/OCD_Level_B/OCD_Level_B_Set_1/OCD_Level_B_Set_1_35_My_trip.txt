My Trip.

For the trip, I packed park maps, snacks, 
and a jacket. 
I tramped on grass and trudged up hills.

I picked a flat spot in Birch Park.  
I fixed my bag and rested.

I heard clicks and sharp snaps.  
I sat up and kept watch.

My backpack!  
It had no picnic or snack!

I tracked that small skunk.  
It sat nibbling on my picnic lunch!

I tramped on grass and trudged up hills.  
But that fat skunk had a picnic lunch!
