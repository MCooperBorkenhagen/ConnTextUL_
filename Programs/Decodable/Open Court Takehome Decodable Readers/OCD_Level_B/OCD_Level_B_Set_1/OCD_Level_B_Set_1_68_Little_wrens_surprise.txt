Little Wren's Surprise.

A wren family lived in a nest in an 
oak tree.  One day they found a 
strange thing on the ground.

What could it be? asked Dad.  
He tried wriggling under it, but 
it was too big.

Can you write with it? asked Mom.  
Mom rubbed the side with a leaf. 
But it didn't make a mark.

Will it hurt us? asked Little Wren.  
Let's wrap it up.
But the paper had a big wrinkle.  
It did not fit.

Little Wren watched a girl come in to the 
yard.  Here's that missing wrench, Ben, 
she yelled.  Now we can fix my bike.

We were wrong, said Little Wren.  
It is a tool to fix things.  
You are a smart bird, Dad told Little Wren.
