Roy and Big Boy.

Roy was a pig who lived on a big farm.  
He enjoyed eating and rolling in muddy 
soil all day long.

But the cat, Big Boy, could spoil his day.  
That cat loved to annoy Roy by howling.

Just avoid him, Cow told Ray.  
We should put him in oil, said Dog.  
That cat is spoiled.

You are my loyal friends, oinked Roy.  
You can help me with my plan.

Next day Rooster woke all the farm 
animals.  
Big Boy was still sleeping in the barn.  
Dog started howling, and all the 
animals joined in!

Stop that noise! yelled Big Boy.  
I want to sleep!  
Big Boy got the point.  
He never howled at Roy again.
