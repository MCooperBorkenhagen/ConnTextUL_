The Rooster and The Gemstone (A Fable).

A rooster and his family made
their home at the edge of the woods.
Winter had been long and cold. 
The family  Father Rooster, Mother
Hen, and six little chicks  did not have
much food left to get through the rest
of the winter.
As the sun came up, the rooster got
ready to leave home. The hen put on a
brave smile. "I am sure you will find us
some food, dear," she said gently to him.
The roaster nodded. He put on a
brave smile as well. "I think today will
be our lucky day," he said to his wife.
"I will be back as soon as I can. Take
care of your mother, children!" he called
to the six chicks.
With that, he went out into the cold.
As he began looking, he made his way
into the woods. After a while, he came
to a strange path. "I haven't tried this way
before. Maybe it will be filled with food!"
the roaster said to himself hopefully.
He went along the path, pecking at the
ground, sniffing at whatever he found
there. Suddenly, he jerked his head up.
He had seen a green flash in the dry
grass by the side of the path. Something
bright was twinkling in the sunlight.
The rooster rushed to the spot, a
hopeful look on his face. When he got
there and looked closely, his look went
from hopeful to hopeless. There in the
dry grass lay a bright green gemstone.
It had clearly been cut and polished by
a master's hand.
The rooster shook his head sadly.
"You are lovely and costly," he said to
the gemstone. "The rich gent who lost
you would give a great deal of money to
get you back again. Many a man would
want to find you and sell you  not I.
Many a fine lady would want to find you
and keep you to wear around her neck â€” 
not I. No, I would trade all the gems on
earth if I could find just one single grain
of wheat!"
With that, the roaster left the bright
green gemstone where he had found it.
Then he went on with his search.
Here is the lesson of this fable: Riches
mean nothing to those who cannot use them.
