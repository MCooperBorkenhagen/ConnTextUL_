Heat: Molecules on the Move.

Heat is one kind of energy. You
can't see it, but you can see what it does.
Plants get bigger and bigger under the
sun. They use the sun's heat and light to
make food for themselves. A truck speeds
along a highway. Under its hood, gas is
being heated up to make the truck run.
The water in a teakettle on the stove
begins to bubble and steam. It's being
heated up to make tea.
When something contains a lot of
heat, we say that it is hot. What makes
some things hot and some things cold?

Molecules. Molecules are the smallest
pieces of a substance. A glass of water
contains many, many drops of water.
Each little drop of water contains
many, many, many water molecules!
Most things around you  such as 
food, trees, cats, dogs, people, streets,
houses  are made up of lots of different
kinds of molecules.

Molecules are always on the move.
The faster a molecule in a substance
moves, the hotter that substance is.
The molecules in a sizzling hot dog are
racing and bouncing about, banging
into one another. But say that you
freeze that sizzling hot dog. As the hot
dog molecules get colder and colder,
they move less and less quickly. Soon,
they are barely moving at all. The hot
dog is really cold.

What happens when you heat up
something cold? Say that you heat up
some cold milk. Before too long, it
begins to bubble. Its molecules have
sped up and are bumping into each
other. The faster the molecules move,
the more heat there is.
You can see for yourself what molecules
do in hot and cold substances.

Try this experiment, but do it with an adult:

Experiment.

 Place two same sized cups side by side.

 Fill one cup with ice cold water.

 Fill the other cup with the same amount
of hot (but not bubbling hot) water.

 Carefully place a drop of red food dye
in the center of the water in each cup.

Make a note of what you think will
happen and why you think it will happen.
Have fun!
