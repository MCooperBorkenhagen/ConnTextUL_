Moose in Love: A Real Story.

In October 1986, a huge moose
stood in a field across from a Vermont
farmhouse. The farmer who owned the
place had never seen a moose on his farm
before, so he called a wildlife officer.
Everyone expected the moose to 
depart, but it didn't. What made it stay?
Well, this is the strange part. The moose,
it seemed, had fallen in love with the
farmer's cow, Jessica.
Male moose, known as bulls, don't
normally make friends with cows, but
this was the time of year for bulls to
mate. Now no one could say that Jessica
looked like a charming female moose.
She was short, fat, and brown and white.
But maybe she was the only female
around, or maybe the bull just couldn't
see very well!
For whatever reason, the moose
followed Jessica everywhere for days.
He sniffed her, licked her back, and
rubbed his antlers gently along her sides.
He shooed away the other cows when they came too close.
People came to the Vermont farm
from all over the world to see the
strange moose. He was called Bullwinkle,
after a well known cartoon moose.
TV teams started showing up. All 
in all, over 75,000 people came to see
"the moose who was in love with a cow."
One man down in Nashville, Tennessee,
went so far as to write a song about
Jessica and Bullwinkle.
It turned out that Bullwinkle was
around three years old, the age when a
bull moose first mates. He tipped the
scales at some 700 pounds. He kept in
shape by helping himself to food around
the farm, eating apples from the trees,
peeling off tree bark, and munching the
ends of the fence posts. But Bullwinkle
never ate any of Jessica's hay.
One day, around the first of the year,
Bullwinkle "broke up" with Jessica.
He just took off and never came back.
Does Jessica miss him? Does she
look up at the stars at night and
wonder where her darling Bullwinkle is?
We'll never know!
