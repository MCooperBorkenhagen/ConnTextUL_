A Goofy Zoo.

There was a zookeeper who lived in a zoo.
He had a baboon, a raccoon, and a cockatoo, too,
A rooster that always flew the coop,
A kangaroo that jumped through a hoop,
A moose that was always getting loose,
And a goose that felt he was a moose.
He had a snake with a man tattoo,
And a goat that always said moo.
He had a poodle that only ate noodles,
And an ape that always made doodles.
He had a woodchuck that always chucked wood,
And a woodpecker that on his head stood.
This zookeeper became a little goofy, it's true.
But if you were he, so would you!
