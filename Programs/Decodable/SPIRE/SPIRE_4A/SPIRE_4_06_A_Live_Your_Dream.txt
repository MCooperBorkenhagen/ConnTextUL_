Live Your Dream.

When James Steel was little,
he dreamed of olden times,
when men were brave and bold.
He could see himself roaming strange
lands on his big white steed. He called his
steed Wind Sweeper, and she was as swift
as the wind. He would do great deeds.
Sometimes, he would save a fair
maiden from danger. She would give him
a kiss and thank him sweetly. He would
not speak. He would just smile proudly.
Sometimes he would help a king
and queen. They would be so
grateful to him that they would
hand him bags filled with gold.
He would take the gold and give it to
people who needed it more than him.
They would cheer as he rode off on
Wind Sweeper.
When James Steel was a teen,
he could see himself sailing the seas.
He would skipper a sleek ship.
He called his ship Wind Sweeper,
and it was as swift as the wind.
He and his men would sail Wind
Sweeper around the globe. They
would do great deeds.
Sometimes they would save people
who had been swept out to sea.
Sometimes they would find people
who had washed up on lonely shores.
Other times, he and his mates would
battle against dangerous men who wanted
to steal gold from the queen's fleet.

No matter where they were, people
would cheer when he and his men sailed
off on Wind Sweeper.
Such were James Steel's dreams.
When he was a man, he held onto his
dreams of wanting to do great deeds.
He became a teacher. Sometimes when
he talked, he would take his class to olden
times. Sometimes he would take them
around the globe. And when he was done
speaking, his class would cheer.

One day, a friend told James,
"You really did hold onto your dreams.
You are still doing great deeds and helping
people. That's what a teacher does!"
