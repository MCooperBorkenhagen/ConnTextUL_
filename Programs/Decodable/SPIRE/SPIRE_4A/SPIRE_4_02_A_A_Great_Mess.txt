A Great Mess.

Kaylin was dreaming. In her dream,
she was eating a pile of Wheat Crackles,
grinning, and rubbing her tummy. She
woke up. It was just six, but she had to
get up. She had to have some Wheat
Crackles! She rushed into the kitchen
and searched the shelf for the Wheat
Crackles box.
Where was it? Kaylin checked under
the counter, pulling out pots and pans.
She was being quite loud. She woke up
her dad. He came into the kitchen and
spoke to Kaylin. He was not happy.
"You woke me up with all your
banging around," her dad said.
"What is the problem?"
So Kaylin told him what the
problem was.
"This is a simple problem to fix,
Kaylin," he said. "The Wheat Crackles
may be gone. But there are lots of things
to eat."
"I really did not mean to be rude and
wake you up, Dad," said Kaylin.

"It's fine, Kaylin. Well, as long
as I am up, both of us can think of
something to eat. Maybe we can make
something. What do we have on hand?"
"There's a little bit of flour left,"
said Kaylin, pulling out a bag.

"And a ripe apple on this plate,"
said Dad, picking up the red apple.
"Here is an egg," said Kaylin.
"We have milk," said Dad, grabbing
the milk bottle. "And some butter."
"This is fun. It's like a puzzle,"
said Kaylin. "What can we make with
all these things? We have flour, milk,
an egg, butter, and an apple."
"I can think of something," said Dad
as he picked up the pancake flipper.
"Can you tell me what it is?"
"I love riddles," said Kaylin. "Let me
think." Her forehead puckered, Then
she grinned. "Apple pancakes," she said.
So Kaylin and Dad made apple
pancakes. Dad flipped them, and Kaylin
put them on the plates. She put pats of
butter on top of each pile. It melted on the
hot pancakes. They had made a real feast!
"Yum!" said Kaylin as she dug into
her pile of pancakes.

Just then, Kaylin's mom walked into
the kitchen. "What's that great smell?"
she asked. She spun around. Pots and
pans filled the sink. The counter top
was dusty with flour.
"Yikes!" she shouted. "The smell is
great, but so is the mess!"

Kaylin and her dad grinned and
nodded. Dad held up a plate of pancakes.
"There are plenty left. Want some?"
"Well," Mom said with a chuckle.
"Great meals sometimes leave great
messes. I'll help you eat, and then I'll
pitch in to help you clean up this mess!"
