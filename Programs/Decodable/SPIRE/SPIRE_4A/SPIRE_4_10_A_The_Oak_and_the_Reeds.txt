The Oak and the Reeds.

A big oak stood in a field beside
a brook. In the brook were many
slender reeds.
When a gust of wind came along,
the great oak stood proudly upright. Its
great branches stretched up to the skies.
But the little reeds bent in the wind and
sang a sad song.
"I see why you are complaining,"
said the oak. He was kind and tried
to be friendly to those around him.
"The slightest breeze that ruffles
the grass makes you bend and sway.
Meanwhile I, a great oak, stand tall and
proud in the strongest wind."
"But we are just fine," said the little
reeds. "We do not mind the wind. We
yield to his gusts so that we do not break.
You are too proud to bend, great oak.
You have been lucky these many years,
but be careful. The end may be near."
But the oak just shook its branches.
"I will not yield to some weak puff
of air that chooses to push at my
leaves," he told the little reeds.
"I do not believe that this would
be a good thing to do. After all,
I am the king of this field.
I must stand tall."
The reeds just sighed and went back
to singing their sad song. As they sang,
a mighty wind rushed out of the west.

The oak stood proudly against it, while
the reeds yielded and bent in the wind.
The wind got stronger ... and stronger
... and stronger. It flattened the grasses and
plants of the field. It whipped the slender
little reeds around. Suddenly the great oak
tree, king of the field, was uprooted. It fell
to the ground with a loud crash and died.
The reeds in the brook, still standing,
were filled with grief to see such a sight.
They cried and sang their sad song.
And here is the lesson of this tale:
It is better to yield when you cannot win.
If you do not give in, you may be lost.
