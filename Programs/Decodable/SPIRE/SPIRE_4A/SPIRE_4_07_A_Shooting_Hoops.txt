Shooting Hoops.

Dan Maxwell really wanted to make
the school basketball team in the fall.
He was not much of a shooter, but he
still had a glimmer of hope that he could
make the team. He had all spring and
summer to get ready.
Day after day, Dan would
shoot baskets with his friends.
Time and time again, he would miss
the hoop, but he kept trying until he
dunked one. When that happened, his
friends would cheer loudly.
Dan could dribble the ball better
than most of the other kids. He could
dribble it in front and just as well in back.
He could dribble under his legs
and all around the other players.
He was quick and nimble on his feet,
and no one could get the ball away from
him. He was so quick that they could
never tell which way he was going to go.
When the other team made a pass,
Dan would pick it off. He was always
stealing the ball. He could block shots, too.
Dan could pass the ball well, too,
setting up other players so that they
made baskets. But when he shot the
ball, it would just clunk off the rim.
Still, Dan never gave up. After a while,
his foul shooting got a bit better, but
not by much. His other shots were still
not falling.
The day of tryouts came. Dan
did his best but missed all of his shots.
He was still running, passing, stealing
passes, and blocking shots. He just wasn't
sinking his shots. The coach watched
Dan carefully. When the time came
to choose players to fill the slots, Dan
Maxwell was number one. The coach
said that Dan would be a great team
member. With him on the team, the other
team would never get hold of the ball!
Dan's best friend, Alvin Mays, was
also picked. Alvin was a great shooter.
With the two of them on board, their
team won almost every game that year.
Good things can happen when you
don't give up!
