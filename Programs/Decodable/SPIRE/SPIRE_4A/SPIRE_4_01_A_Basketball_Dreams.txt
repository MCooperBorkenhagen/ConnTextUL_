Basketball Dreams.

Some kids dream of being in a
rock band. Some want to act in films.
Dean Hong dreamed of playing
basketball. He spent all his spare time
on his basketball skills.
He could run fast. He could pass well.
He could make his shots. He was small,
but he could leap up and touch the rim
of the basket. His pals felt he could make
the team.
"You play like a real champ!" said
Rex. "I love to watch you dunk the ball!"
"And you are a great passer!" said
Mick. "You get the ball just where a
player can reach it to make the shot."
On the day of the tryouts, Dean
woke up at six. To get in shape, he ran
before breakfast.
When he got back, he walked into
the kitchen. Dad was there.
"Dad, I take care of myself. I am fit
and healthy," he said. "I have played
basketball each day to get better. Do
you think I will make the team?"
"You are in peak shape," Dad said.
"Try not to think so much about the
tryouts. Just do the best you can. I think
you will be fine. If you do not make the
team this time, there is always the next
time to try."
"Thanks, Dad," said Dean. "Wish
me luck!"

"I wish you luck," said Dad. "But
you can't go yet. Sit here and have a
big breakfast!"
At tryouts, Dean was ready. He
played well. He was hopeful that the
team would pick him. The next day,
the team list was posted. Dean had
made the team.
Dean's team, the Wildcats, went on
to play well that year. He had a great
time playing. And his dad and his pals
had a great time watching him play.
Dean and his team did not win at the
County Games, but they came close.
"The Wildcats will win it all next year,"
said Dad.
"That would be great," said Dean.
