Light.

Back when people lived in caves,
they could not light up their homes
by pushing a button, flipping a switch,
pulling a chain, or lighting a lamp or
candle with a match. The light they
had to use at night was moonlight or
the light of a bonfire.
Today we can make night
into day both inside and outside.
Streets are lit all night long. Lights
let baseball players play at night.
People can stay at their jobs at night.
There isn't a job or game that has
to stop because it is nighttime and
the daylight is gone.
In the beginning, people most
likely used a burning stick of thick
wood for light. People then found out
that sticks gave better light if the ends
were dipped in animal fat, or in pitch.
Racks were put on the walls to hold
the lit sticks, so people could see
without the bother of having to hold
the sticks themselves.
Then people came up with an even
better way to light their homes. They
would dip a string made of moss or
grassy plants, which is called a wick, into
something fatty, such as beeswax.
They would dip the wick many times,
until the wax got thick around the wick.
When it was lit, it would shine brightly
and last a long time. We still use such
candles today.
More than one hundred years ago,
people discovered that gas was a good
way to make lights in lamps that would
stay lit and not go out. These lamps
were used to light streets and houses.
The gas came to the lamps from pipes.
Gas lamps could not be moved from
place to place, but they made good street
lights and wall lights.
This all may seem funny to us, but it
is the way it was.
