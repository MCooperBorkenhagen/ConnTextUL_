Just Like Old Times.

Kit sat in the den, watching the rain fall
outside. It just kept raining and raining,
and the puddles got bigger and bigger.
Kit grinned. The puddles made her think
of Katlin. When Kit was little, Katlin was
her best pal. They were Kit and Kat.
On a rainy day, sometimes Kit would
call Kat. Other times, Kat would call Kit.
They would say the same thing. "I will
be outside before you!" Kit would say.
"No, you won't!" Kat would say back.
"I will be outside before you!"
Both of them would scramble into
raincoats and rubbers. They would dash
outside and almost run into one another.
Then the real fun began. They would
splash in the puddles. They would try to
catch raindrops. They would slide on the
wet grass.
Then at lunchtime, sometimes Kit's
mother would call them in. At other
times, it was Kat's mother who called.
Kit and Kat would dash inside and take
off the wet things. They were careful not
to trail mud into the house.
As they ate a hot lunch, they would
tell jokes to make each other giggle.
They would put cold hands around mugs
of hot tea until they were all toasty.
Then they would quickly bundle up in
raincoats and rubbers, and dash outside
to play some more.
But that was before Kat and her
mother had left East Oakdale. Now they
were in another state. Kit missed her old
pal. They would email each other all the
time. But it was just not the same. Rainy
days were no fun without Kat. They just
made Kit sad.
She sat up. She could hear sounds
from the kitchen. There were whispers
and giggles.

"What is going on?" Kit wondered.
Was that her mom on the stairs?
"May I come in?" someone asked.
It was Kat!
"What are you doing here?" Kit
shouted. She gave her old pal a big hug.
"It's so funny. I was just thinking of you.
We had such fun on rainy days like this."
"My mom had to come into East
Oakdale. I talked her into letting me
come. So, let's go! Get into your raincoat
and rubbers. There are mud puddles
waiting outside!"
It was just like old times.
