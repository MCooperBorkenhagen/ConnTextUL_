Sunset Magnet.
The Coles got to the lake as the sun was setting. The bike path ended at the shore, just as the old man had told them it did.
They got off the bikes, tossed the helmets on the grass, and ran quickly to the lake. "What a wonderful way to end this day," said Raymond. "A sunset picnic is fun."
Mom put an old gray blanket on the grass. The kids helped to unpack the picnic baskets. Then they sat and ate.
"After the picnic, may we take a walk?" said Chadwick.
"That will be fun, said Dad. "I wonder what is on that path?"
So they packed the things back into the picnic baskets.
"We cannot walk long," said Mom. "It is getting late and chilly."
They walked on the path to a cliff by the lake. There was a shack on the cliff. "I can tell that someone is in the shack," said Dad. "Watch the smoke."
"I wonder who lives there," said Mom.
"Maybe bandits," said Chadwick, with a smile. "That must be a really bad joke," said Raymond. "Maybe it is a hermit's shelter," said Dad. "Listen to that strange tune!" said Mom.
Both Chadwick and Raymond began to hum. Mom and Dad winked.
"So you can hum the bandits' tune?" said Dad, with a grin.
"Come on, kids," said Dad. "This is fun. We will check the shack. Let us find who is playing that strange tune."
No one talked. Dad went close to the shack.
"It is the kind old man who told us the way to the lake, said Dad. â€œHe is playing a flute."
They sat quite still and listened to the strange, wonderful tune. After a while, the old man quit playing.
Mom, Dad, Chadwick, and Raymond clapped. The old man got up when the clapping began.
"Welcome!" the man said. "So my tune pulled you to my home, did it? My fine tune is a magnet," the man said, "just like this lake at sunset. That is why I call my tune 'The Sunset Magnet.'"
