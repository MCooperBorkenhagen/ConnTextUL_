My Clothes Do Not Fit.

Ned and Nelly are twins. Both of them have gotten tall. They have no summer clothes that fit.
Ned and Nelly want to go clothes shopping. "My clothes do not fit, Mom," says Nelly. "My clothes do not fit," says Ned.

"I cannot take you shopping today," says Mom. "But, Ned, will you take the puppy for a walk?"

Ned finds a penny and a dime and bends to pick them up. RIP! It is the leg of his pants.
"These pants are done!" he says.

Ned goes home. He says, "Mom, I got a rip in my pants."
Mom smiles. "That is OK, Ned. They do not fit. Go play with Nelly. I have to do my job."

Ned and the puppy go to play with Nelly. Nelly is playing with the kitten. The puppy is happy that the kitten is there.
The puppy and the kitten like to play. Today, the playful puppy runs to the kitten.

The kitten runs from the puppy and jumps up on the wall. The puppy cannot climb up. He stands by the wall and watches the kitten.
The kitten is not at all happy! She hisses at the puppy.


Next the kitten jumps on Nelly. RIP!

The kitten ripped Nelly's  top. The rip is so big that Nelly thinks it is hopeless. Nelly thinks and thinks. All of a sudden Nelly says, "I can fix this top, and I can fix your pants, Ned."

Nelly goes inside. She cuts the top by the rip and then makes a hem. Next, she cuts and hems Ned's ripped pants.
"I am done, Ned!‚Äù she calls.


"Mom!" Nelly yells. "I made some clothes. What do you think of them?"
"I love the clothes you made," smiles Mom. "But I think we will go shopping. I will get my wallet."
So Nelly and Ned did go shopping with Mom.
