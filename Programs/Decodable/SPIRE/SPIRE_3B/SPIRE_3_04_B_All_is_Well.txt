All is Well.

My day did not begin well.
I woke up at ten today. I had missed my bike ride with my pal Ray.
"Mom, did Ray come by?" I called.
"Yes," she said. "But he said not to wake you. He said he will call you." "I will go find him," I said.
I washed up. I pulled on my clothes.

Then I called Ray. "Is Ray there?" I asked his dad.
"He went somewhere on his bike. I think he went to get you and Tom," said Ray's dad.

I got on my bike and rode to Tom's home. I asked Tom's mom if Tom and Ray were there.
"No, I think they went to get you and Lin," she said.
It was a long, hot ride to Lin's home. "Is Lin here?" I asked her mom. "No, she went with Tom and Ray to the path by the bandstand; she said.
Just as I got to the path by the bandstand, the sky went gray.

CRACK!
I pushed my bike as I ran to the bandstand. My clothes were wet, but I was safe.
The bandstand was filled with kids. There were tom and Ray and Lin! "I missed you at home," said Ray, with a grin. "Well, this is fun," I said.

Then the sun came back, and it got hot. We all wanted something cold, so we went to get a snack.
We sat on a bench and ate. Next, we played some games. at last, we all went on a long bike ride, and it was a fund day.

When I got home, mom asked, "did you find Ray? Did you have a fun day?"
I said, "All is well that ends well."
