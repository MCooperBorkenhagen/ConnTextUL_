Blake's Flying Class.

Blake wants to fly a plane.

Blake did go on a plane with Mom and Dad. It was fun, but she wants to be the one to fly the plane.

Blake belongs to the Flying Club. She is in Miss Hill's flying class. If Blake can pass the class, she can begin to fly. She must take a test.

Miss Hill did call on Blake. "Blake!" she said.
But Blake was thinking of flying.

At home, Blake's mom said, "Help me dry the plates."
But Blake was thinking of flying.
"Blake!" said Mom. "Blake!"

"Blake, if you want to fly, you must pass your class," said Dad. "You must try to do your best!"
"But my class is dull," said Blake. "I just want to fly."
"Well, Blake," said Mom, "some things are complex and take time. If you pass your class test, your name will be on the list, so then you can fly."

But Blake did not finish all the things Miss Hill said to do before the next class. Also, Blake did not try when she was in the class. She just sat in class thinking of flying. It was all she did think of.

Blake did not do well in class, so she did not pass the test Blake's name did not get on the list. She felt like crying.

"Do not cry, Blake," said Mom. "Crying will not help."
"You will have to take the class one more time and try your best," said Dad. "You will have to pass this time if you want to fly!"

"You can do it if you try!" said Mom.
"We will help if you want us to, and Miss Hill will help if you ask," said Dad.
Blake got it. It was not fun to get such a lesson, but all was not lost. Blake will try this time.

Blake will do what Miss Hill asks in class. She will do well and pass the test. Blake's name will be on the list. Then it will be time to think of flying!
