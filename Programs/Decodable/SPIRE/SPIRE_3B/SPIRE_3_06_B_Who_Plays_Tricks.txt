Who Plays Tricks?

The Hammonds like to play tricks. One day they go to supper. When it is time to go home, Dad cannot find his glasses. "Did someone hide my glasses?" he asks.

"No," says Mom.
"I did not hide them, says Kenny.
That's funny, says Jenny.
The next day, Mom wants to walk in the sun, but she cannot find her cap. She thinks someone has played a trick. "Did someone hide my cap?" she asks.
"I did not," says Dad. "Not me," says Jenny.
"I did not take it," says Kenny.
So Mom takes Dad's cap to walk in the sun.
That same day, Jenny wants Teddy when she naps. "No Teddy, no nap," says Jenny. But where is Teddy?
Did someone play a trick? Mom cannot find Teddy. Dad cannot find Teddy. "I did not hide it," Kenny says.
Jenny will not take a nap. Mom and Dad are not happy.
The next day, Kenny has a muffin. Mom calls him to do something.
When Kenny comes back, the muffin is gone. "Did someone take my muffin?" he
asks.
"I did not," says Dad. "Not me," says Jenny.

Kenny thinks. Mom is missing a cap. Dad is still missing his glasses. Jenny is missing Teddy, and he is missing his muffin.

All of a sudden, Kenny jumps up. Where is Buddy? Kenny goes to find him.
Kenny finds a muddy case with glasses, a muddy cap, and a muddy Teddy. He does not find a muddy muffin. He does not find a muffin at all.
Kenny smiles. He says, â€œBuddy! So you are the one who played the tricks!"
