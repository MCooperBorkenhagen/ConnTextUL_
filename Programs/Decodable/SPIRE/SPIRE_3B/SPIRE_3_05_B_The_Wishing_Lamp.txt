The Wishing Lamp.

Jim goes to a sale. A man sells him an old lamp. The man says, "If you rub an old lamp like this, you may get a wish."

The lamp is dusty. "I bet this is a golden lamp," says Jim. So he washes it. The lamp is not golden. "Well, it may give me some wishes," Jim says.

Jim rubs the lamp. "I wish I was a singer, " Jim says. "I wish I had lots of cash. And I wish that I was a baseball player." Time passes. 
"This lamp does not give wishes!" Jim says. 

"This is hopeless," Jim says. "I did not get my wishes. " Jim puts the lamp into the trash. 
Jill takes the lamp from the trash. "I will gladly take a lamp like this," she says. 

The old lamp has no top, so Jill puts a plant in it. "I must thank Jim," she thinks. 

Jill goes to Jim's home. "Thank you, " she says. "Why are you thanking me?" Jim asks. 
Jill says, "This lamp is useful!"
"It is?" Jim asks. "Did it give you a wish?"

"A wish?" asks Jill. "Well I wished I had somewhere to put this plant, and that is what I got."
Jim says, "Can I have it back?" "OK," says Jill. 

Jim takes the lamp and rubs it. "I wish I was a singer," Jim says. "I wish I had lots of cash. And I wish that I was a baseball player. "
Jim does not get his wishes. 

Jim gives the lamp back to Jill. "It is hopeless," Jim says. "I did not get my wish. Take the old thing."

"I can help you get one wish, " Jill says. "Do you want to play baseball?"

So, Jill and Jim play baseball and have fun all day.
