The Fish Pond.

Jeff and Dad did love to fish.
"Can you hold this box, Jeff?" said Dad. "Off we go into the wild!"
By the time the sun came up, Jeff and Dad were almost at the fish pond.
"We will have fish at lunch!" said Dad. "Yum!" said Jeff.
Dad drove the truck into a lot next to the pond. "OK, Jeff," said Dad, "let us go catch some fish!"
Jeff and Dad did stroll on the path to the pond. "This pond has lots of fish," said
Dad. "We will find a bunch."

Dad and Jeff sat ... and sat ... and sat. Jeff did not catch a fish. Dad did not catch a fish.
"So, where are all the fish, Dad?" said Jeff.
"My pal Mike comes to this pond all the time," said Dad. "He told me there were lots
of fish here."
That made Jeff smile. "Well," he said, "the fish must not like us!"

Just then, someone gave a yell. "So this is where I find you! "said Mike.
"Mike," said Dad, "I am glad you came. There are no fish in this pond. No fish will
bite."
Then Mike had to smile. "This is not the pond I told you to fish in," he said. "It is the next pond - that one there." Then Jeff and Dad did smile. "Come with me," said Mike.
So Dad, Mike, and Jeff went to the next pond and did catch lots of fish. Dad and Mike did fry the fish. Dad, Jeff, and Mike ate all the fish at lunchtime. Jeff ate the most!
