Big Hippos, Small Hippos.

Hippos are mammals, just like cats and dogs and you.
A hippo can live both on land and in the water. It lives with  10 to 30 hippos, both female and male. Female hippos are smaller than males. Male hippos are called bulls.

Hippos live in lakes and waterways that run through the grasslands of Africa.

Hippos spend most of the day in the water, close to shore.

The hippo has small legs and swims under water. Africa is hot, so hippos spend lots of time in the water. In this way, the hippo's thin skin does not become dry.
The hippo's nose is on top. You can spot its nose when the rest of the hippo is hidden under the water.

When the hot day ends and the sun sets, hippos come from the watering holes to graze on grass and small plants. They graze on the shores of lakes and on the banks of waterways.
Hippos may have to walk up to six miles from the watering holes to graze. Big hippos can take in lots of grass at one time.

Hippos may be in danger while walking to find plants and grass. Lions may hide in the tall grass, where hippos do not expect to find them. If they must, hippos can run quickly and dive into the water, where they will be safe.

Hippos are big, and they lumber when they walk on land. But they are lovely to watch as they swim.

A small hippo begins its life under water. Then it swims to the top.

The small hippo's mom takes care of it under water. The mom can swim to the top and give the small hippo a ride. That must be fun! It also must be wonderful to watch.

Do you think hippos are endangered? No, they are not endangered. There are lots of hippos left in the wild.
Maybe one day you can go to Africa where they live.

Then you can watch hippos yourself. What a thrill that will be!
