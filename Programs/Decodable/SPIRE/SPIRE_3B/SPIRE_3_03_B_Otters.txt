Otters.

A lake can be a fine home to an otter.
The mom otter can make a den in the mud and clay. She brings moss and grass into the den. This will be the otter pups' home.
The mom otter wants the pups to stay in the den. She will help the pups to stay safe.
The pups will get big and fat. Then they will stray from the den.
Today, the mom will take the pups on a big trip. She will take them to play in the lake.
At the lake, she sprays the pups with water. They are all wet!
The pups are playmates. They like to glide in the lake.
Then the mom finds lunch for the pups.
Otters love fish and crabs.
The otters may crack a crab shell. This is the way they like to snack.
The pups are done with lunch. They go back to swim and dive.
Then it is time to rest in the shade. The mom licks the pups.
Today was a big day, and the otters must rest. It is bedtime and they are glad.
