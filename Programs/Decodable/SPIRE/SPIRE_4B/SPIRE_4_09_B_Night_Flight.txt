Night Flight.

Why does the sight of a bat flying in the night sky frighten some people? Lots of people think of the bats they have seen in frightening films.
These people might be happy to find out that the bats in the sky
are catching bugs for food.
A bat looks a bit like a mouse with wings. But a bat can take flight, unlike a mouse. Bats wings are not made of feathers. They are made of skin. This makes the wings thin and light, so bats can fly fast.
Bats stay out of the bright light of day. They just come out at night. Night is the best time to catch bugs.
A bat sleeps hanging by its feet all day. It sleeps with its wings
tightly folded around itself. Some bats might hang from a beam under a road and some might hang from the branch of a tree.

Some bats live alone. Some might "hang out" with lots of other bats in a cave.

Bats make high pitched sounds to help them find food. They aim the sound at a bug, and the sound comes back to them. This tells the bat right where its food is. People cannot hear these high pitched sounds.
A mother bat has one pup each year. The small pup clings tightly to its mother when she is in flight.
The pup will soon get big. It may live as long as 20 years unless something catches it. A snake and a cat can catch a bat.
 
People are a danger to bats, too. Some people are frightened by them and might try to hit them.
But lots of other people delight in bats. Why? They see that bats can catch and eat one bug every six seconds.
Some people put up bat houses so bats will make a home there.
The bats sleep safely in these houses all day.
Then at night, the bats come out and swoop right down on the bugs that might eat healthy plants. They get rid of the pests people do not want.
Bats might look frightening, but they are good to have around.
