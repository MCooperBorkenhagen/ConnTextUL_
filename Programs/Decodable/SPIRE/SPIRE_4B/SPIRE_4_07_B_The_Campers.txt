The Campers.

"That was a good book," said Josh, after he was done reading it to his little sister, Liz.
"I want to go camping like the man in the book," said Liz.
Liz looked outside. A van and a bus rumbled past the house. "The man in the book was in the woods," she said. "Can you camp if you do not live in the woods?"
"Yes," said Josh. "I will prove it to you."
Liz and Josh walked to the back of the house. "I camped out here when I was little," said Josh.
Josh hung a sheet on the clothesline to make a tent. He stooped to spread an old blanket under the tent.
"That looks good!" said Liz.
The man in the book did not go to the shop for food. He found his food outside. Liz wanted to do that, too.

Josh and Liz looked all around for something to eat. There was some fruit that looked good on the apple tree.
Josh found some mint Mom had planted. He plucked the leaves, washed them, and put them in some water. "If we set this in the sun, soon we will have mint tea," he said.
"Yay!" said Liz. "We have food, something to drink, and a little tent just like the man in the book!"
Liz and Josh played in the tent all afternoon. They ate apples and drank mint tea. They talked about the book.
"The man in the book took a bike with a big moose and talked with a funny raccoon," said Liz. "I wish I had some animal friends like that."
Josh chuckled. "You do have animal friends," he said. "You are friends with all the dogs and cats on the block!"
Josh was telling the truth. Liz took people's dogs on walks. That was almost like a hike with a moose!
And though Liz had not talked to a raccoon, she did talk to cats.
Three cats came to visit the tent that afternoon.
When it was time to clean up and go in, Liz told Josh, "I think the man in the book should visit us. He would have lots of fun in our little tent."
