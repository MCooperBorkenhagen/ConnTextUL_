Free!

A lad walked along a cool brook in the wood.
With his bug book and butterfly net, the lad stood.
He saw somethings flying, then asked, "What are those?"
The butterfly landed and sipped from the rose.
The lad was quite shocked. He took a good look
At a strange butterfly like the one in his book!

The bug was a rare one. Its marks were the proof
That this was the real thing 	and not just a goof.
The lad took his net, and he swung it and scooped
That butterfly up. Yes, he got it and whooped!
The lad looked at the bug and  made out on its wing,
Crooked stripes like an "F‚Äù and an "R" of all things! On the other were 2 Es. The lad understood.
So he set the bug FREE, said goodby, and felt good.
