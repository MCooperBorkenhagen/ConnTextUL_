A Job at the Ranch.

Dad woke Jill and Dee. "My friend Ray needs help at the ranch this weekend," he said. "Do you want to volunteer?"
Jill and Dee screeched with glee.
Dad gave them a big smile. "I think that means you want to go."
All was still at the ranch.
"Ray said he has something for us to see," said Dad. "I will go and find him."
Jill and Dee stretched out on the grass. They watched the sun peek through the trees.
"I still feel sleepy," said Jill.
"This is a fine spot for a nap," said Dee.
A breeze floated by. Jill and Dee sniffed. Something smelled strange. It smelled of "Sheep!" they both said.
Just then, Ray and his ranch hands led a flock of sheep to the top of the hill. Dad walked to meet them.
"So this is what you wanted us to see!" said Jill.
"I have nineteen sheep," Ray said. "This is my dog Holly. She helps take care of the sheep."
"We need some help shearing the sheep," said Ray. "Could you help us?"
Jill and Dee cheered.
Dad winked at Ray. "I think that means yes," he said.
The ranch hands led the flock to the shearing shed. Dad and Ray had to catch some sheep. They squeezed them into a pen. The ranch hands sheared each sheep's coat.
The sheep seemed smaller without their coats.
"Will the sheep feel cold?" asked Dee.
"No," said Ray. "In the spring, it feels wonderful to them."
Ray asked Jill and Dee to make a pile of the sheep coats and clean them. The coats were filthy. Jill and Dee picked out bugs, grass, weeds, and mud.
The job was done. All of the sheep were sheared. The coats were cleaned and stacked. The ranch hands went home.
"We did a fine job. Thank you for all your help," said Ray to Jill and Dee.
They walked out of the shed. A sweet breeze floated by. "I feel sleepy," said Dad.
"I need to put my feet up," said Ray.
Jill and Dee let out a chuckle.
"I think that means they need a nap," said Jill.
"Come with us," said Dee.
"We have the best nap spot all picked out," said Jill. "It has been waiting for us all day!"
