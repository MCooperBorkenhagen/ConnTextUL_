Miss Hiss.

Nell has a pet cat.
Miss Hiss is Nell's cat. Miss Hiss is a fun pet. Miss Hiss is a strong cat!
Nell and Miss Hiss went to the pond to sit on the grass. Miss Hiss did sniff the grass next to the pond.
A big frog did jump up from the grass.
Miss Hiss got a whiff of the frog. Then the frog sat still.
"What will Miss Hiss do?" said Nell.
Miss Hiss did sniff the frog.
Miss Hiss did puff up.

The frog still sat still!
Just then, Miss Hiss got a whiff
of a dog.
Miss Hiss sat up!
"Will Miss Hiss sit still?" said Nell.
Miss Hiss did not sit still.
Miss Hiss did hiss!

Then Miss Hiss ran fast through the grass and hid.
The dog and the frog went into the pond to swim.
Nell went through the grass to get Miss Hiss.
The cat was a mess.
Miss Hiss sat still, and Nell did brush off the twigs and grass.
Nell held the cat and gave it a pat. Miss Hiss did not miss the frog and the dog!
Miss Hiss was glad just to nap in Nell's lap!
