Plane Pals.
"It is time to make the trip to Cape Cod," said Mom.
"O.K.," said Wade. "A plane trip is fun!"
Mom and Wade drove to the plane.
On the plane, Wade sat next to a kid.
"I am Luke, the kid said."What is your name?""I am Wade," said Wade. Luke said, "Do you live in Washington?"Wade said yes.  Luke and Wade did talk and talk.
The plane ride was long. The plane got to Cape Cod at last. As the kids got off the plane, Luke said, "When you get back to Washington, do you want to call and talk?"Wade said, "Mom, can I call Luke at home in Washington?""Yes," Mom said. "What fun!"Luke's dad met him at the gate.
"Can I call Wade while I am here?" Luke said to his dad. His dad said yes.
The kids did wave.
"I  will call you," said Luke."Talk to you then," said Wade.
"That was a fun trip," Wade said to Mom. "I made a pal here on Cape Cod and in Washington!"
