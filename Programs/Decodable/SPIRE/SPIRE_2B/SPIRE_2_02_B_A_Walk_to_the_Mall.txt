A Walk to the Mall.

Jen and Nat walk to the mall.

Jen and Nat will shop at the mall.

Jen and Nat run through a small bed of moss.
"Halt!" a tall man yells. "Do not run. You will slip on the wet moss!"


But Nat slips and falls.


Nat's leg hits a wall.

"Help!" Jen calls to the tall man.
The tall man runs to help Nat. "I will call your dad," said Jen.

Nat sobs. The tall man lifts him up.
Nat's dad pulls up in a small van. The tall man tells him that Nat did run and slip.
"Thank you!" said Nat's dad to the tall man.
"Thank you!" said Nat and
Jen to the tall man.
All was not lost.
Dad, Jen, and Nat got into the small van and still went to the mall.
Nat felt glad.
All that was left of his fall was a small spot of moss on his pant leg.
