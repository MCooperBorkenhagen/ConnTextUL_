The Swamp.
Tong and Dan did walk tothe swamp.The lads did walk on the path.
"I want to watch the bugs!" said Tong."I am not fond of bugs," said Dan."Bugs sting."
"Lots of bugs do not sting," Tong said."But lots of bugs do!" said Dan.
At the swamp at last, the lads did watch a fat frog.The frog did not watch the lads. It did watch a bug."Tong, that bug is a moth!" said Dan.
"Dan, that is not a moth,"said Tong.  "It is a wasp!  Run!"Dan ran up the path.Tong did swat at the wasp.
Then Tong went to get Dan. Dan sat on a log.
"Did you get stung?" said Dan. "I did not get stung," Tong said. "But I did wallop that wasp.I am strong."
"I did watch you wallop that wasp, and I am glad!" said Dan."Yes, but that wallop was not fun,"said Tong. "I want lunch. Do you?""Yes, but not at the swamp!" said Dan.
Tong and Dan did walk to get lunch at a shop.
