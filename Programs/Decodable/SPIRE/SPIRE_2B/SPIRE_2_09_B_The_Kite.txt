The Kite.
Rose and Jake will walk to the lake.
I can bring the kite! Rose said.
Can I wade in the lake? Said Jake.
You cannot wade in the lake, said Rose.
Mom is not with us.
When the kids got to the lake, Jake sat on the shore next to Rose. Rose let the kite go up.  It went from side to side. It went up and then it came back.
Then it went up and up. Yikes! Jake said.  Is that safe? Will the kite string snap? I do not think it will, Rose said.
I think the kite is safe.
Then a big gust of wind came.
It yanked the kite from Rose's grip.
Jake and Rose had to chase the kite.
Both of them ran on the shore.
Where is the kite? Jake said. Is it stuck in the rocks?
It is somewhere here, Rose said.
Yes, but where! Said Jake.
Then Jake and Rose got close to the lake.
Is it in there? Jake said.
I hope not, Rose said.
Then a man came up to Jake and Rose.
The kite was in his hand.
The kite! Thank you! Rose and Jake said to the man.
The kite was in the lake, Rose said.
I am glad the kite is safe, said Jake.
