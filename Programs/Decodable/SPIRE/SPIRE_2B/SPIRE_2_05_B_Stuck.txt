Stuck!

Chuck had a pickup truck and a big bucket.
Chuck put rocks into the bucket.
Then Chuck did dump the bucket of rocks into his truck.
With his pickup truck full of rocks, Chuck was off.
Whack! Crack! Chuck's truck struck a big log and went off the path.  The back of the truck sank into thick mud.
I will call Mack, said Chuck.  You rang? Said Mack.
I did, said Chuck. Help! The back of the truck is stuck.
What a mess! Said Mack. Can you help? Said Chuck.
Mack put a stick in the mud. Yuck! Said Mack.
The truck was still stuck.
What will Chuck and Mack do?
Mack got up.
Yes, that is what I will do! Said Mack.
Get the bucket, Chuck, said Mack.
Put rocks from the truck into the bucket. Then we will dump  the bucket of rocks into the mud! Mack dug in the mud with a pickax.   Chuck put the rocks in the mud.
The truck is not stuck! Said Chuck. Thank you, Mack. I am back on Track!
