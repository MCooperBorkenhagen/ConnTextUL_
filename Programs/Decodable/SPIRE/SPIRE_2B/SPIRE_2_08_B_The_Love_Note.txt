The Love Note.
When Tess go home, Jane was on the steps.
What is that, Sis? Said Tess.
I got this note, Jane said.
Who gave you the note? Said Tess.  Is it a joke?
I hope it was Dave, said Jane.
I hope it is not a joke.
Tess did smile.
Dave is cute, said Tess.
I like him.
Then someone put a rose on Jane's desk.
A rose! Said Jane. I love this rose! But who is it from?
Nate, did you put this rose on the desk? Jane said.
Nate said, I did not put the rose on your desk. I like you but I think it is...
Just then, Dave came in.  Nate left. Dave had a big smile.
Jane, said Dave, I want to ask you on a date to a whale watch. Will you come? 
Yes, said Jane. And did you send the note and the rose?
Yes, I did, said Dave.
That was quite cute, said Jane.
I love the note, the rose and a whale watch.
