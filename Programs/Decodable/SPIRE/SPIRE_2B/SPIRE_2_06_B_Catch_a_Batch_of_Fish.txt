Catch a Batch of Fish.

Ann and Mitch sat in the van with Dad. 
"Bring back a batch of fish!"  said Mom. 
"I will bring back a big batch," said Dad. 
"I will catch lots of fish," said Ann. "And I will catch lots of fish," said Mitch. 
"And I will catch a batch of fish," said Dad. 
Dad did stop the van. 
Mitch and Ann did walk fast through a patch of tall grass. "Catch up, Dad!" said Ann. Dad did catch up. 
Mitch and Ann did fish and fish. Dad did rest. 
Mitch did catch a fish. 
Ann did catch a fish. 
Then Mitch and Ann did pull in lots and lots of fish. The bucket was full!
Dad got up. "Mitch! Ann!" said Dad. "You did catch lots of fish. You did catch a batch!" 
When Mitch, Ann, and Dad got back, Mom said, "Did you bring a batch of fish?" 
"I did catch a lot of fish," said Mitch. 
"I did catch a lot of fish," said Ann. 
"And I did not catch a fish," said Dad. " Fetch your fish, Mitch and Ann. " 
"What luck" said Mom. "Mitch and Ann did catch a batch of fish, and Dad did bring it back!"
