The Humpback Whale.

You are a mammal. So are dogs, cats, foxes, and rabbits. And so are whales. Did you think whales were fish? No, they are mammals, but they are mammals that can swim like fish under water!
In many ways, whales are not like fish. They do not have scales like fish. They have soft skin, just like us.
Whales also have a thick layer of fat under this skin. It is called blubber. With all that blubber, whales do not get cold.
One kind of whale is called the humpback whale. It is as long as a bus and has a set of long flippers. It also has a small fin on its back.
When the whale goes to dive, the fin gives its back a humped shape. This is why this whale is called a humpback.
Yes, the humpback has a fin with a shape like a hump. It also has lots of bumps and lumps on its skin. It may not be a lovely mammal, but it is lovely to watch as it jumps and dives and playfully splashes.
A humpback lives on fish and on small shrimp called krill.
One whale has to take in lots and lots and lots of krill at dinnertime!
If you dive, you can swim beside these wonderful whales. A humpback will be quite careful with you.
You will not be in danger. The whale is not careless with its long flippers. You will be grateful that these big mammals act with such kindness.
Humpback whales can also sing! They sing quite lovely songs. This may be the way they talk.
Those who have listened to the humpback's songs are filled with wonder. If you are lucky, a humpback whale will sing to you!
Humpback whales are endangered. They are almost extinct. There are approximately 20,000 left.
Find what can be done to save the humpback whales before they are gone.
