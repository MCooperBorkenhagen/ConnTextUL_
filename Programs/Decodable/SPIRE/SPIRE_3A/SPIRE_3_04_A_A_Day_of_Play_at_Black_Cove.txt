A Day of Play at Black Cove.

It was a hot, hot day. Hal and Eve were at Black Cove.
Hal watched Eve play in the sand by a big hole someone had dug.
She sifted the sand. Then she filled a bucket to the top and dumped the sand into the hole.
"What's up, Sis?" Hal asked Eve.
"I want to fill up this hole so that no one falls in!" said Eve.
She filled the bucket, dumped it, filled it, dumped it, filled it, and dumped it. This went on and on. Hal watched the small tot. At last the hole was full.
"What can I do next?" asked Eve.
"We can take a walk," said Hal.
He brushed Eve off, and they walked on the sand. Eve walked with such small steps. She held Hal's hand, so he did not walk fast.
They talked as they walked. They wanted to find shells. A wave came up fast and sprayed them. Hal splashed Eve, and she splashed him.
They both yelled. Then Hal picked up a pink shell that had washed up on the shore. He handed it to Eve, and she thanked him. They walked on some more.
At last, Hal said, "Well, we have gone a long way. It is time to go back. Let's get into the shade, Sis. I do not want you to get a lot of sun."
"Why not?" asked Eve.
"Well, there was a man who stayed in the sun a long, long time," said Hal with a grin. "He melted!"
"He did not," yelled Eve. "You just told me a joke."
"Yes, I did," said Hal. "But let's walk back in the shade, just to be on the safe side!"
So Eve held Hal's hand and walked in the shade all the way back.
