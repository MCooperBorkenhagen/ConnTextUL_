No Time to Ride.

James wants to save a lot of cash. He has some in the bank, but he wants to get some more.
He wants to get a top grade bike. His old clunky bike has a flat tire and a bent rim that he cannot fix.
James sits and thinks. All of a sudden, he hits upon a plan. He will be a pet watcher, watching a pet when someone goes on a trip.
Yes, he will set up a Pet Watcher Shop! What if he watches more than one pet at a time? That way, he can get more cash and have a useful job.
James sets up his Pet Watcher Shop. The next day, Kelly brings in her pet dog, Rusty. James is thrilled. Kelly stays while James pets Rusty and talks softly to him.
Then she goes. She will pay James when she gets back. The dog misses Kelly, but begins to like James.
Kelly comes back in six days. She is thankful that she left her dog with James.
Rusty is more playful and stronger than before. What a job James has done! Kelly tells all her pals. They want James to watch more pets.
Before long, James has lots of pets to take care of. James also has lots of cash! He goes with his mom to the bike shop and gets the bike he wants.
On the way home, James is singing. "I am so lucky!" he says to his mom. The next thing James has to do is find time to ride his top grade bike.
He does spend so much time at his Pet Watcher Shop!
