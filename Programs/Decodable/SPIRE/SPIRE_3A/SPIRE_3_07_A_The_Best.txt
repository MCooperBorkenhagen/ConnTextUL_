The Best.

Abby was the fastest runner in her class. She had jogged with her mom from the time she was just a small child. But she wanted to run faster than a jog.
Running became her hobby. At the age of ten, Abby got a winner's cup. She had run the fastest mile of all the kids in her state.
Then when Abby was 16, she was set to go in the ten mile run. Lots of the best runners in the state were going to run. The winner got a big prize. Abby was thrilled to be a runner. But she also wanted to be the winner.
On the big day, it was hot and windy. Abby felt fit and strong. When the man yelled "Go," Abby set off with the rest of the runners. She was running well.
Abby was running up a hill when it happened. She got a cramp in her left leg. She had to stop, sit on the sidelines, and rub her leg.
All the runner ran past Abby. She felt sick. The run was not going well at all!
Abby got back up to run, but the cramp was still there. Her leg throbbed.
"It's just not your day," someone called to her. "Give up!"
"No," Abby said grimly. "I may not win, but I will not be a quitter."
She got up and began limping her way to the end of the run. She crossed the line last.
Her mom and dad ran to her and gave her a big hug.
"Well, I did not win this time," Abby said.
"Yes, you did," said her dad. "You did not quit. That makes you a winner. The best kind of winner!"
Abby nodded. "I did my best," she said softly. "That's all I can do!"
