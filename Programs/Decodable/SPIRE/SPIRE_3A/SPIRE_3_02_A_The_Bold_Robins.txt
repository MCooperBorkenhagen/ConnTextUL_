The Bold Robins.

It is spring. The robin sings as she makes a nest of twigs, mud, and grass. The nest has a cup shape.
When the robin has eggs, she will put them all in this nest.
Then she will sit on the eggs a long time.
The eggs hatch and the hatchlings want to be fed. A hatchling is a small robin. Robins like an insect for lunch and love to munch on a plump fly.
The mom robin gets bugs and pulls things from the grass to give to the small hatchlings.
The hatchlings are fed by the mom robin. The bugs go from the mom's bill to the hatchlings' bills.
The hatchlings get big, almost as big as the mom robin!
They become small robins.
And they get bold and brave!
So the bold, brave robins try to fly, and the bold, brave robins fall. But the robins try and try.
At last the robins can fly up into the sky. The robins are gone and the mom is left behind.
She is sad that the robins have gone, but she is glad that the robins will do well in life.
