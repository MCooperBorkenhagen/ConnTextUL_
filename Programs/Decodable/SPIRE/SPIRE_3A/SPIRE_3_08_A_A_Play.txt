A Play.

Penny and her pal Pablo were planning to do a skit for the class contest. They wanted the skit to be funny.
Penny dressed up like an old man. She wore an old hat, a red vest, and gray checked pants. She had a picnic basket with a small white bunny rabbit inside.
Pablo dressed up like a bandit. He had on a black mask and a helmet. His bandit was planning to kidnap the bunny that was in Penny's basket.
When the skit began, Penny came into the class from the hall. Pablo walked in behind her. He was humming a tune. Penny just kept walking.
All of a sudden, Pablo grabbed at the basket. The bunny got upset and jumped into Penny's hands!
Then the bunny hopped onto Penny's hat. The hat fell off, and the rabbit went hopping into the class.
The children in the class yelled as the rabbit hopped past them. Penny and Pablo ran to catch the bunny rabbit, and Pablo fell and lost his helmet. Penny ran into him and fell as well! The rabbit sat still and watched them get up.
Pablo and Penny did not get upset. They had not planned it, but the skit was quite funny this way.
So they just kept gong. At last, they got the rabbit and the skit ended.
Penny and Pablo's skit was the winner of the contest. It was the most fun to watch. Also, Pablo and Penny kept on acting when things began to go badly.
And the bunny that had made such a mess of the play?
It became the class mascot!
