The Rays of the Sun.

The sun helps you. 
You have to have the sun to live.
The sun gives us day, so it is not black all the time.
The sun makes it hot, so where we live is not as cold as can be all the time.
But the sun can also be bad.
The sun's rays can do bad things to your skin.
If it is a hot, hot, hot day with a lot of sun, stay in the shade when you can.
Put on clothes that hide your skin.
Put on sunblock.
Put on a hat.
So watch when the sun shines on a hot day!
Do not let a lot of sun get to your skin.
That way, you will stay safe.
Then you can have fun in the sun!
