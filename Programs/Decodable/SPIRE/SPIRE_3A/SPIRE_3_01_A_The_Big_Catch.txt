The Big Catch.
In the spring, Jake likes to fish at the pond. One spring, he went with his best pal, Fred, to fish.
Fred said, "We must try to catch a big bass! My mom will fry it when we get home."
"Yes, let's try," said Jake.
Jake put the skiff into the pond. Then he and Fred got into it and went to the best spot to fish.
Jake had lots of grubs that he had dug up. Fred held the pan of grubs.
Jake held his rod. He put one grub on the end of his line.
Jake and Fred sat and sat.
"We have sat still a long time," said Fred. "Why? Where are the fish?"
"We want to go home with a big fish," said Jake. "Sit still, and try some more. The fish will come."
A fly sat on Fred's hat.
"What a big fly!" said Jake. "Let me get it!" Jake hit Fred's hat with his rod. The rod made Fred's hat fall into the pond.
"No! I must get it," said Fred. He got his hand on the hat, but it was stuck to Jake's line. The line was stuck in the pond. So, the hat was stuck on the line, and the line was stuck in the pond!
"Help me!" said Fred. "The hat is stuck, and the line is stuck. And I think I did catch a fish!"
Something big held on to the line, but Fred and Jake were strong. A fish came up on the end of the line. So did Fred's hat!
"Yikes!" said Jake. "That is a big fish. It is a big bass!" The fish made a big splash. Fred got hold of the bass and put it in the skiff.
"What a catch," said Fred.
"What a hat," said Jake.
