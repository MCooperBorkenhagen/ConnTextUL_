A Tale from Crete.

Long ago, Greece was a land of kings
and queens, gods and goddesses. The 
people of Greece mingled with their
rulers and gods. Sometimes, though,
humans got in trouble if they did not
please the gods and rulers.

Daedalus was an inventor
from Crete, a part of Greece. Because
of his superb skills, he was sometimes 
called on to help both gods and the 
Greek rulers.
He made all kinds of toys and tools.
People say he invented the sail, the
potter's wheel, the saw, and the ax.
King Minos was fond of
Daedalus, who sometimes made toys for
the king's daughter. Daedulus also built a
beautiful castle for the king.

Then one day, a strange baby was
born on Crete. It had the body of a
human and the head of a bull. This
baby monster was called the Minotaur.
He became cruel and very 
frightening as he grew up.

People were so afraid of the Minotaur
that he was locked up in 
a maze built by Daedalus.
The maze had no roof, just walls. No
one could escape its miles of hallways.
The Minotaur roared and banged on 
the walls. The only way to please the
beast was to feed it live people. So young
people were brought from another city
to be fed to the monster.

One day, a hero called Theseus
came to Crete. He
planned to kill the Minotaur to protect
people from being eaten. Theseus and
the daughter of King Minos
fell in love right away.

The princess decided to help Theseus.
She handed him a long 
thread. He tied one end of the thread
near the opening of the maze, then he
held on to the rest as he looked for the
Minotaur.
Theseus took the monster by surprise
and killed him. Then he followed the
thread back through the maze. He left
Crete, taking the princess with him to
be his bride.

King Minos was very
angry that Theseus had left with his
daughter. He thought that Daedalus
must have helped the 
princess and Theseus escape. No one
else was that smart! The king was so
angry that he threw Daedalus and his
son, Icarus into the maze.
Even though Daedalus knew how to
find his way out, he could not escape.
Strong men guarded the gate.

Each day, birds flew over the land of
Crete. As Daedalus watched
the birds, he came up with a new plan.
He collected feathers that fell from the
flying birds. Finally, he had a huge pile.
He joined the feathers with wax to form
a pair of wings. Then he made another
pair for Icarus.

Daedalus tested the wings and found
that they could lift him up. He handed the
other set to Icarus and warned him, "Do
not fly close to the sun. Its heat will melt
the wax, and your wings will come apart."
Both Daedalus and his son put on the 
wings and waited for a strong breeze to
lift them. "Remember! Do not get too 
close to the sun," Daedalus repeated.

Up in the air, Icarus was
overjoyed by the feeling of freedom.
Below him was the clear blue sea. He
looked up and saw puffy clouds against a
bright sky. Daedalus enjoyed
the air and freedom almost as much as
Icarus did.

As Icarus flew higher, he could see
more of the world. He could feel the
warmth of the sun on his face. But Icarus
forgot his father's final words.
Higher and higher he flew. Suddenly,
the wax on his wings began to melt.
Feathers dropped into the sea. Icarus
could not stay in the air. He fell into the
sea and drowned.

Daedalus's heart was
broken by the loss of his son, but he flew
on to the land of Sicily. The 
King of Sicily sheltered him.
Back in Crete, King Minos 
was very angry that Daedalus had
escaped. King Minos sailed off to look
for him. He knew that the only way to
find Daedalus was to play a trick.

When King Minos got to Sicily, he 
asked if their king could pass a thread
through a seashell. He knew that just
one person could do this  Daedalus.
The King of Sicily did just what King
Minos thought he would do. He secretly
asked Daedalus for help. Daedalus put a
drop of honey on one end of the shell.
Then he tied a thread to an ant at the
other end. The ant crawled through the
shell to get the honey, pulling the thread
along with him.

King Minos knew then
that the King of Sicily had
gotten help from Daedalus.
King Minos tried to find him, but
Daedalus had friends who saved him.
Daedalus stayed in Sicily for the 
remaining years of his life, inventing
many more wonderful things.
