The Lost Ring.
The man was a king.
The king had a big ring.
The king did swing with the ring on the swing set.
The king lost the ring on the swing. The king was sad.
The king had a dog, Fang. His dog had big fangs.
Fang dug in the grass. The ring was in the grass.
The ring is on Fang's fang.
The dog brings the ring to the king.
The king is glad that Fang is his pet.
The king will swing with the ring in his fist.
