Hank's Fish Tank.
Hank had a big fish tank.
In the tank was a red fish and a pink fish. The pink fish and the red fish swam fast in the tank.
The red fish swam in a rush to get to the top.
The red fish did jump up, but Hank had a mesh net on the top.
The red fish went plunk, but it did not splash Hank. "Thanks, red fish, " said Hank.
I got a jump.
The pink fish swam to the top but did not jump. "Jump, pink fish!" said Hank.
The pink fish swan to the bottom, then to the top, and the pink fish did jump.
With a big plunk, the pink fish did splash Hank.
"Thanks, pink fish!" said Hank.
"I got a jump and a splash!"
