The Fish Wish.
I had a big fish on the rod.
I did not get the fish off the rod.
I got help from Tim. Tim had a net.
The fish was in the net. The fish did a flip in the net. The fish got Tim wet.
Tim and I felt sad. The fish was sad. 
Tim and I got the fish off the rod.
I let the fish swim off. The fish got its wish.
