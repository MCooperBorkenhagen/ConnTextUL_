A Whiz Kid.
Jen is a whiz kid.
Jen is a whiz at math. Jen can add fast.
Jen can spell.
Jen can spell "whiz" fast.
Jen is a whiz at lunch. Munch, munch, munch.
When is Jen not a whiz kid? Jen is not a whiz with a top.
Jen spins the top.
The top flops.
Jen is a flop at tops!
Jen grins. Jen will spin and spin the top, and it will spin and flop.
