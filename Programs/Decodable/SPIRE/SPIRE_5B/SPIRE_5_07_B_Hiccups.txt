Hiccups.

Moe gobbled his eggs and toast. Then he quickly drank his milk, put his dishes in the sink, brushed his teeth, and picked up his backpack.

"What is the big rush, Moe?" asked Mom.

"Today is the class trip to the zoo," said Moe. "I cannot wait to see the snakes and wild birds!"

"I can tell," said Mom, with a smile.

Moe found some of his friends waiting by the bus. Soon the teacher, Mr. Dodge, and the other kids came. "Hic!" said Moe. All the kids giggled.

"It looks like you have a case of the hiccups," said Mr. Dodge. "Hiccups can happen when you eat too fast."

"I did eat fast," said Moe. "Hic!"

"Hiccups can happen when you are all wound up about something, too," added Mr. Dodge.

"I am wound up," said Moe. "I cannot wait to see the snakes and... Hic!"

"Kids, your job is to cure Moe's hiccups before we get to the zoo," said Mr. Dodge. "Get on the bus, and off we go!"

"I have a cure for hiccups," said Max, sitting down in his seat. "Eat some sugar."

"I would if I had some sugar," said Moe. "But I am sure Mom did not put any in my lunch. Hic!"

"Do you have a dill pickle in there?" asked Jill. "I eat one when I have the hiccups."

Moe looked in his lunch bag. "No pickles," he said. "Thanks anyway, Jill. Hic!"

"How about an ice pop?" asked Joe. "Eating an ice pop makes hiccups go away. But you have to be upside down while you eat it."

"No hanging upside down in the bus," yelled Mr. Roe, who drove the bus.

"No problem," said Moe. "I do not have an ice pop in my lunch bag. If I did, it would have melted by now, anyway. Does anyone have a cure that does not use food? Hic!"

"I stand on my tiptoes and reach up as high as I can," said Ming.

"No standing until the bus stops," yelled Mr. Roe.

"Maybe you could just think about something besides the hiccups, said Joe. "Name some animals you might see at the zoo."

"Hic! I might see some snakes," said Moe. "I might see a doe. Hic! I might see a wolf. Hic! I might see a moose. Hic!"

"This is not working," said Joe. "Meg, do you have a cure?"

"Well, my sister plays her trumpet to get rid of hiccups," said Meg. "She says it works. She takes slow breaths in and out as she plays."

"No trumpet playing on the bus," yelled Mr. Roe.

"Hic!" said Moe. "I do not know how to play a trumpet, but I can take slow breaths in and out."

Moe took one breath in... "Hic!"

Then one breath out... "Hic!"

In... "Hic!"

Out... "Hic!"

Moe looked glum.

"Maybe it does not work without a trumpet," said Meg. "Woe is me!" said Moe. "Hic!"

"I think Joe was on the right track," said Kim. "You need to think about something besides the hiccups. I have a pen and notebook. Do you want to play tic tac toe?"

"Sure," said Moe. "You can go first. Hic!"

"No tic tac toe on the bus," yelled Mr. Roe. Then he gave a big smile. "It is a joke!" he said.

"Hic!" said Moe.
Kim put an X in the first spot. Moe put an O in the next spot.
"Hic!" he said.

X... O... X... When Moe put his next O down, he shouted, "I
win!"

"Yes, said Kim. "Can we play again? You go first this time."

"Sure, said Moe. "I will use my lucky letter O." But this time the letter O was not so lucky.

"I win!" said Kim.

"Way to go," said Moe. "Whoa, wait. My hiccups are gone! Tic tac toe cures hiccups!"

"Yay!" shouted all the kids.

"No shouting on the bus," yelled Mr. Roe.

"You did it!" said Mr. Dodge. "I am proud of you for helping Moe. Now we can all go to the zoo in peace."

"Thanks!" said Moe. "The zoo will be much better without the hiccups."

The kids got off the bus and waited at the ticket booth. There was not a sound. Then, all of a sudden...

"Hic!" said Mr. Dodge.
