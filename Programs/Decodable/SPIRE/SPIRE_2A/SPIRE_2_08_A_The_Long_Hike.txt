The Long Hike.
Mike and Clare went on a hike next to Clare's home.
Mike had a big backpack with lots of snacks in it.
Mike and Clare did hike and hike.
Then Mike and Clare came to a big rock.
"Let's sit on that rock and have a rest," said Mike.
"Fine," said Clare. "I want a snack. Let's have something from the backpack."
"What is that hole?" said Mike.
Just then a rabbit came from the hole.
"Come here, rabbit," said Mike.
"The rabbit is cute," said Clare.
"Let's give him a snack."
The rabbit ate some of the snack.
Then the rabbit did hop back into his hole.
"Let's hike back home," said Clare.
"I do not want to get up!" said Mike.
"This hike was long. I hope that next time the hike home is fast. Next time, I will take a bike!"
