Tricks will not Fetch.
Rick had a pet dog, Tricks.
Tricks did not do Tricks.
Rick did pitch sticks.
Tricks just sat.
Then a bug did sting Tricks.
Tricks did scratch.
Tricks did not get up to catch the bug.
"What will I do with Tricks?" said Rick. "Tricks will not fetch. Tricks will not get up to catch a bug. Trick just sits."
"Well," said Rick's pal Mitch, "I do not think you can call him Tricks. I think you can call him Lump. A lump just sits."
"That is what I will do," said Rick. "I will call him Lump."
Just then, Tricks sat up.
"Quick, pitch a stick!" said Mitch.
Rick did pitch a stick.
Tricks got up!
Tricks ran to fetch the stick!
"I think Tricks did not want you to call him Lump," said Mitch.
"I am glad that I can still call him Tricks!" said Rick.
