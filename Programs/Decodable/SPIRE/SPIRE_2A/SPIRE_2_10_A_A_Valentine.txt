A Valentine.
You can make a valentine.
A valentine is a small note that you give to someone you like.
All kids like to get valentines.
The best valentine is one you make yourself.
You can fill it with hugs.
You can put a kiss in it if you want.
You can just print "I like you!" inside.
You can print at the top, "To a best pal from your best pal."
Put your name at the bottom of the valentine.
You will make someone smile when you give a valentine.
That is a fine thing to do.
Make a valentine.
Print something inside.
Send it to someone the next time you can.
Sometime, someone will send one back!
