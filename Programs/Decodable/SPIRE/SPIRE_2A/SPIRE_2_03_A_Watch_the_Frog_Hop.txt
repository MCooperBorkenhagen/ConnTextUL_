Beth had a pet frog that was kept in a box. 
"Can I watch the frog hop?" said Beth's pal Liz.
"Yes," said Beth.
Beth put the frog on the grass.
The frog just sat and sat.
"I do not want to watch the frog just sit," said Liz. "I want to watch it hop!"
"Well," said Beth, "what can I do?"
"You can put a bug on the grass," said Liz. "The frog will hop to get the bug."
"I will get a bug with this net," said Beth. "You watch the frog."
Beth left Liz with the frog and ran to the top of the hill.
The top of the hill was full of bugs.
Beth got ten fat bugs with the net and ran to Liz.
Beth put the bugs in the grass next to the frog. 
The bugs did walk past the frog.
Then the frog did jump!
The frog was fast.
Liz and Beth did watch the frog hop and jump to get the bugs.
Then the frog just sat.
It did not jump.
It did not hop.
The frog was full!
