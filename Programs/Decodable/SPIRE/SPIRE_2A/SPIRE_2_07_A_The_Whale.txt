The Whale.
Whales do not often get close to the shore.
But this whale was very close to the shore.
A big jet of water came from the hole on the whale's back.
Some men did watch the whale from a tug in the water.
Just then, the whale swam to shore on the crest of a big wave.
The whale did land on the sand!
It was stuck on the sand.
The men on the tug came fast.
The men did want to help the whale.
A man did attach a rope to the whale.
More men did fix the rope to the hull of the tug.
The tug did pull the whale from the sand and into the water.
The whale is safe!
The men smile.
It was a thrill to save the whale!
