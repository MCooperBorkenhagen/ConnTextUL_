Bad Luck.
The duck sat in the pond.
It did not quack.
It felt sad.
"I had bad luck," said the duck.
"I did not swim back to the dock. The ducks at the dock got a snack from a man. I did not get a snack."
"I will swim to the end of the pond," said the duck. "I can sit on the sand and think."
The duck swam and swam.
The duck got to the sand and sat on a rock.
A man sat on a rock next to it.
The man had a sack with his lunch in it.
The duck said, "Quack."
The man's sack fell in the sand.
Sand got into the sack and in the sandwich.
"Yuck," said the man. "Sand is on the sandwich. What bad luck."
The man did not want his lunch with sand on it.
The man left it in the sand.
"Yes," said the duck. "What luck! Sand on a sandwich is not bad luck to a duck."
The duck stuck his bill into the sand to get the sandwich.
"What a snack," said the duck.
Such luck!
