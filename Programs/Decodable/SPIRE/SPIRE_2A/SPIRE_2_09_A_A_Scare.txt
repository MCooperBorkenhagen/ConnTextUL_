A Scare.
Nate was in the watermelon patch with Dad.
Then Nate went to the shed to get a rake.
In the shed, Nate got a scare.
Nate gave a big yell.
"Yikes, a snake!" said Nate.
Dad ran into the shed.
Nate was pale.
"What is it?" said Dad.
"That hole in the back of the shed has a big black snake in it," said Nate.
"It went into the hole when I came into the shed. The rake is in front of the snake's hole. Can you pick up the snake?"
"A snake is not tame," said Dad.
"It is not safe to pick up a snake with your bare hands. Where did it come from?"
"It came from the grass," said Nate.
"There is just one thing to do," said Dad. "The snake must slide itself back into the grass. There is a pole on the side wall of the shed. Can you get it?"
"No, you get it, Dad!" Nate said.
Dad got the pole. 
With that pole, Dad did poke the snake.
The snake came up from the hole.
Then Dad did chase the snake into the grass with the pole.
"I will plug the hole in the shed. The snake can not get back in," said Dad.
"What a scare!" said Nate.
