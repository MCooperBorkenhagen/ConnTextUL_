The Math Test.
Liz sat in math class.
Ms. Rath had a test to hand to the kids.
Ms. Rath said, "Jan is not in yet. Is Jan at lunch?"
Jan ran fast to Ms. Rath's class.
"I am in, Ms. Rath," said Jan. "I did trip on the path."
Liz did rush to get a thin pad on Jan's cut. "I am glad Jan is in," said Ms. Rath. "And I am glad Liz can help Jan."
"Ken, can you help with the tests?" Said Ms. Rath.
"I can," said Ken.
"Top job, Ken!" Ms. Rath said.
"Dig in kids," said Ms. Rath. "This is a fun math test!"
