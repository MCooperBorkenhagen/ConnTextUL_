Snip and Snap.
Snip is a kid.
Snap is a cat.
Snap bats at a big twig.
Snap sits in the grass.
Snip sprints in the grass.
The big twig is in the grass. Snip trips. Snap gasps!
Snip has a limp.
Snip sits in the grass. Snip is sad.
Snap sprints past Snip. Snip is glad Snap can sprint. Snip has a grin.
Snip is glad Snap is his pal.
Snap is glad Snip is his pal.
