Lunch on the Sand.
Sal, Chad and Chad's mom sit on the sand.
Chad sets up a net.
Chad runs, hits, and slams. But Sal wins!
Chad's mom gets lunch.
Chad has punch, and Sal dips a chip.
Chad has punch on his chest, and Sal has dip on his chin.
Chad's mom is not mad. Chad's mom has a grin.
Chad is such a mess! Chad has to mop up the punch. Sal has much to do. Sal has to get the dip off his chin.
Next Chad dips a chip, and Sal has punch. Sal and Chad do not get in a mess.
Sal and Chad had such a fun lunch on the sand.
