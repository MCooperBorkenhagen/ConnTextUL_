A Red Sash.
I had on a red sash.
Dad was in a big rush.
I was in a big rush. Splash went the hash on the sash.
I felt sad. I did sob. Dad felt bad.
Dad and I got in his van.
Dad and I got to the shop and went in.
I will get the red sash. Dad got his cash.
I had the red sash on in a flash.
Dad and I left the shop.
Dad got a hug!
