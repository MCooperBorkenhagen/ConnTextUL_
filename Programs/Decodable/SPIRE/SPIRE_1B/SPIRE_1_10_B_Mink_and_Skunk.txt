Mink and Skunk.
Wink the mink is hot.
Rob the skunk is hot.
Wink and Rob sat next to the spring.
Wink said, "I can jump into the spring. I am strong. I can swim!"
"Rob," Wink said. "Let us jump in and swim!"
Rob did think, "Can I swim? Am I strong?"
Rob cannot swim. "I am not strong", Rob said to Wink. "I will sink."
Wink said, "This long log is a trunk. Grab it and you will not sink."
Rob did think, "Will I sink if I grab this trunk?"
Rob and Wink got the trunk into the spring. Splash! "Rob!" said Wink. "I dunk! I swim! I do not sink."
Rob did rush to Wink. Rob did think, "Can I swim? Yes, I can. If wink can swim with that trunk, then I can!" 
Rob did grab the trunk and swim.
Rob said, "When it is hot, I can swim. Think you, Wink!"
